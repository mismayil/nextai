    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the goals of our company among others is to provide users with answers to their questions. Since we are a legal startup, specially focused on immigration and visa, we are interested in helping people with their visa related questions. There are tons of sources on internet like cic, canadavisa and etc. where you can find answers to these kind of questions. But wouldn't it be great if you could just ask them in one unified platform by just chatting with an agent who is not only able to answer your questions, but also can make suggestions based on them, point you in the right direction and connect you with people like lawyers who can help you in your journey to a new country? So, that is why we are building this AI chatbot solution trained with an immigration/visa domain that can offer answers to people's questions and guide them in the right path to a destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build this chatbot solution, we are leveraging already existing tools and technologies such as messenger platforms and AI agents such as Dialogflow. These agents are able to handle basic conversations and certain domains. We need to extend this domain to immigration/visa and this means we have to be able to match user question with an answer. In other words, we have to train a model which can recognize similar sentences. So, it is a Natural Language Understanding problem and we need to encode and decode sentences in some fashion to find semantically related sentences. One approach to doing this is to map sentences that share semantic and syntactic properties to similar vector representations. There is a model called Skip Thoughts (by Ryan Kiros, Yukun Zhu, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Richard S. Zemel, Antonio Torralba, Raquel Urtasun, Sanja Fidler) which is distributed sentence encoder based on this approach. This model has been trained with a vast amount of text from wiki pages, but it also provides a mechanism for a simple vocabulary expansion which is what we need to extend our domain with visa related concepts and this is done by encoding words into vectors which is called word2vec (by Mikolov et al.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec is computationally-efficient predictive model for learning word embeddings from raw text. It uses either of 2 approaches - Continuous Bag-of-Words model (CBOW) and the Skip-Gram model. Algorithmically, these models are similar, except that CBOW predicts target words from source context words, while the skip-gram does the inverse and predicts source context-words from the target words. Word2Vec is trained using 3 layer neural network (1 input, 1 hidden, 1 output) and actually hidden layer produces the word embeddings so we discard the ouput layer. Here in this assignment, I would like to prototype this model by training it on sentences collected from https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-questions-faq.html.  "
