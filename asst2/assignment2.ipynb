    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the goals of our company among others is to provide users with answers to their questions. Since we are a legal startup, specially focused on immigration and visa, we are interested in helping people with their visa related questions. There are tons of sources on internet like cic, canadavisa and etc. where you can find answers to these kind of questions. But wouldn't it be great if you could just ask them in one unified platform by just chatting with an agent who is not only able to answer your questions, but also can make suggestions based on them, point you in the right direction and connect you with people like lawyers who can help you in your journey to a new country? So, that is why we are building this AI chatbot solution trained with an immigration/visa domain that can offer answers to people's questions and guide them in the right path to a destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build this chatbot solution, we are leveraging already existing tools and technologies such as messenger platforms and AI agents such as Dialogflow. These agents are able to handle basic conversations and certain domains. We need to extend this domain to immigration/visa and this means we have to be able to match user question with an answer. In other words, we have to train a model which can recognize similar sentences. So, it is a Natural Language Understanding problem and we need to encode and decode sentences in some fashion to find semantically related sentences. One approach to doing this is to map sentences that share semantic and syntactic properties to similar vector representations. There is a model called Skip Thoughts (by Ryan Kiros, Yukun Zhu, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Richard S. Zemel, Antonio Torralba, Raquel Urtasun, Sanja Fidler) which is distributed sentence encoder based on this approach. This model has been trained with a vast amount of text from wiki pages, but it also provides a mechanism for a simple vocabulary expansion which is what we need to extend our domain with visa related concepts and this is done by encoding words into vectors which is called word2vec (by Mikolov et al.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec is computationally-efficient predictive model for learning word embeddings from raw text. It uses either of 2 approaches - Continuous Bag-of-Words model (CBOW) and the Skip-Gram model. Algorithmically, these models are similar, except that CBOW predicts target words from source context words, while the skip-gram does the inverse and predicts source context-words from the target words. Word2Vec is trained using 3 layer neural network (1 input, 1 hidden, 1 output) and actually hidden layer produces the word embeddings so we discard the ouput layer. Here in this assignment, I would like to prototype this model by training it on sentences collected from https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-questions-faq.html.  "

Furthermore, if the Refugee Board believes that you are a member of a terrorist group, have participated in human rights violations or have committed serious non-political crimes, you can be excluded from refugee protection.

In reality, it is not just one points-based system, but a number of points-based immigration programs that aim to attract, rank, and/or invite certain individuals and their families to immigrate to Canada.\n",
      "The Federal Skilled Worker Class is the federal government’s flagship immigration program. The concept is relatively simple; there are up to 100 points available for a number of factors including age, level of education, language ability, work experience, whether or not the individual has arranged employment in Canada, and certain adaptability factors. If the individual can claim 67 or more points, he or she is eligible to enter the Express Entry pool.\n",
      "Here, the individual (now a candidate, having created an online Express Entry profile) is ranked along with other candidates, including candidates who entered the pool via other programs that allow people with Canadian work experience and skilled tradespersons to immigrate to Canada. The Express Entry pool is a competitive environment, with a points-based ranking system where candidates are awarded up to 1,200 points under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) for a variety of factors. The government conducts periodic draws, in which the top-ranked candidates are issued an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence.\n",
      "Confused? Let’s use a hypothetical example. A U.S. citizen wants to immigrate to Canada and, having filled out a free assessment form, finds that she can claim 74 points under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. She creates an Express Entry profile, where she is awarded 500 CRS points. She then receives an ITA is a subsequent draw from the pool. This ITA provides a 90-day during which she may submit a complete immigration application, and from that point the government aims to process the application within six months.\n",
      "In addition to this federal system, there are also a range of points-based immigration categories under the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). The criteria for these categories are set by provincial and territorial governments, who may issue a nomination certificate to successful applicants and their family members, if applicable. Under the PNPs, the federal government only oversees admissibility factors, including medical and security background checks.\n",

      "\n",
      "Canada does not have a President. The head of government is the Prime Minister.\n",
      "The Prime Minister is not directly elected by the electorate. He or she is voted into that office by members of the House of Commons, which meets on Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa.\n",
      "Members of Parliament are elected using a first-past-the post system, whereby the candidate who wins a plurality of votes in a riding (like a congressional district) is elected to serve that riding in Parliament.\n",
      "Currently, five political parties are represented in the House of Commons. The governing Liberal Party holds a majority of seats. The Conservative Party, with the next highest number of seats, forms the official opposition. The New Democratic Party (NDP) has a sizeable number of seats and is generally perceived to be a social democratic party of the left. The Bloc Québécois, which has a handful of seats, is devoted to the interests of the province of Quebec, and the Green Party has a single elected Member of Parliament (MP).\n",
      "There is currently no avowedly anti-immigration party with elected representation at the federal level. Each party recognizes the contributions that newcomers to Canada make to the economy and Canadian society.\n",
      "Canada does not have states. Instead, it has 10 provinces and three territories. Each province and territory has its own democratically-elected government that holds jurisdiction over certain areas of governance. Other areas of governance are held by the federal government, while certain powers are shared between the federal and provincial/territorial governments.\n",
      "Only Canadian citizens may vote at the federal and provincial levels.\n",

riding like congressional district is elected to serve that riding in parliament currently five political parties are represented in the house of commons the governing liberal party holds majority of seats the conservative party with the next highest number of seats forms the official opposition the new democratic party ndp has sizeable number of seats and is generally perceived to be social democratic party of the left the bloc québécois which has handful of seats is devoted to the interests of the province of quebec and the green party has single elected member of parliament mp there is currently no avowedly anti immigration party with elected representation at the federal level each party recognizes the contributions that newcomers to canada make to the economy and canadian society

is recommended that travellers requiring an eta submit an application well in advance of their intended departure date as some requests may require more time to process if this is the case for your application you can expect an email fromirccwithin hours informing you what your next steps are can someone else complete an applicationfor an eta on my behalf yes friend or family member may complete the online formto apply for an eta on behalf of an individual travelling to canada there is an option to indicate this on the online eta form can make multiple visits to canada with an eta yes you can

the day on which the electronic travel authorization is cancelled or the day on which new electronic travel authorization is issued to the applicant leave for canada in few days but cannot submit the additional documents required for my eta application by the requested deadline can still travel to canada if you are waiting for someone eg police department doctor or another third party to send you documents or have problems uploading the documents and cannot submit them by the deadline you may submit acase specific enquiryto request an extension to the deadline if you are not sure how to submit the documents requested for your eta application follow these step by step instructions do individuals who obtain study permit or work permit also need to apply for an eta as ofaugust individualswho are issued an initial study or work permit will automatically be issued anetaalong with their permit for work permit or study permit renewal applications theetawill not be automatically renewed if you wish to exit and re enter canada by air you will need to ensure that youretais still valid do all work permits study permits issued by visa posts ports of entry and vegreville after aug have etas attached to them if so how do ifind out what the eta number is study permits and work permits issued to visa exempt foreign nationals on or after august had an eta issued with them the only work permits and study permits issued on or after august that would not have had an eta issued with them are work permit and study permitextensions issued by the vegreville case processing centre in alberta for ease of reference the eta number can be found in the letter of introduction given to study permit and work permit holders if an eta is issued with work permit study permit is it valid for the length of time of the work permit study permit or is it valid for years or when the passport expires if it before years the validity of an eta issued to visa exempt foreign national alongside work or study permit is independent from that of the permit therefore the eta is valid for five years or passport expiry whichever occurs sooner that same eta can be used for multiple entries to canada including after march in addition the eta is electronically linked to the individuals passport therefore he must use that same passport when travelling to canada if an individual received awork permit or study permit at canadian port of entry but did not received confirmation letter afterwards how would he or she check whether he or she hasbeen issued an etaand what theeta number is in this instance in order to obtain theeta number the individuals should submit case specific enquiry form to immigration refugees and citizenship canada ircc explainingthesituation an email response from irccwill contain theeta number if an individual does not know his or her eta number for example if he or shewasn told what his or hereta number when receiving work permit at port of entry would he or she then able to apply again for another eta would the system prevent someone from getting two etas individuals who find themselves in this situation or who simply wish to re apply for new eta may do so at any time once the more recent eta is approved it will replace the one that already exists if the individual applies for another eta but on different passport that eta – once approved – would not replace the one that already exists it would be tied to the second passport which the individual could use when travelling to canada by air in either case the system will not prevent the individual from proceeding what are the possible reasons for refusal reasons for refusal may be for prior criminality or for medical reasons in terms of criminal inadmissibility something as seemingly minor as an old dui driving under the influence going back number of years can result in being rejected even if the crime was minor in nature and even if the person criminal record has been clean since it took place canada still has the right to deny entry some examples of convictions that could make you inadmissible to canada include dwai theft petty theft larceny assault drunk disorderly conduct obstruction of justice possession of marijuana cocaine or other controlled substances drugs and cautions issued in the united kingdom more serious reasons for refusal can include membership in terrorist organizations espionage participation in war crimes or crimes against humanity international human rights violations membership in organized crime groups criminality or issues endangering public health such as tuberculosis in – the total number of visa exempt foreign nationals who arrived in canada and were deemed inadmissible for entry at air ports of entry was this resulted in significant expense delay and inconvenience for these foreign nationals other travellers the airlines and the canadian government as such the eta system has been brought into operation if am refused an eta is there some way can still visit canada citizens of eta required ie trv exempt countries who are refused an eta may be issued atemporary resident permitdepending on the nature and circumstances of the inadmissibility and the continuing rationale for travel the visa office responsible for the applicants country may have its own application form for temporary resident permits applicants should check the visa office to find out about its specific application procedures is the eta system similar to the electronic system for travel authorization esta in use by the united states of america the eta system mirrors the current us electronic system for travel authorization esta program and is very similar to it in number of ways the governments of canada and the us have stated that eta and esta systems form common approach to screening travellers outside the north american perimeter are there any age exemptions for eta no all travellers from eta required countries regardless of their age need an eta when they fly to canada will having entered canada previously trigger secondary examination records of previous entry to canada will not trigger secondary examination unless those records contain adverse information to that enter in the application for an eta do individualswho have been issued aconfirmation of permanent residence copr document need an eta in order to land in canada visa exempt foreign nationals who have been issued confirmation of permanent residence copr document also receives an electronic authorization to travel to canada and

passport and valid confirmation of permanent residence document when will citizens from brazil bulgaria and romania be able to apply for an eta there is no confirmed date yet for eta expansion for
