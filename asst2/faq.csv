For more information see: how to apply through the immigration processimmigration process; and through the citizenship processcitizenship process."
"Does an adopted child need a travel document, like a visa, to come to Canada?","Yes. Before bringing your child to Canada, you must apply for the necessary travel document in order for your child to legally enter Canada. The document is either a permanent resident visapermanent resident visa, or a Canadian passport through a grant of citizenship. To avoid unnecessary delays and costs, adoptive parents should not plan to return to Canada with the adopted child until they know with certainty that all immigration or citizenship requirements have been met."
How long will the adoption process take?,"Adopting a child in another country takes time. Depending on the child’s country of origin, the process may take two years or longer.Adoption cases are processed on a priority basis. That is true whether parents are applying for permanent residence or citizenship for their adopted child. There are no significant differences in processing times between the two processes. Find out more about processing timesprocessing times.Long waits can seem unreasonable when you are anxious to welcome a new family member. However, to protect the child’s rights, international adoption must be a rigorous process. Both your provincial or territorial government in Canada, and the government of the country where the child lives, must approve the adoption.To ensure the child’s rights are protected, visa officers must be satisfied that:
adoptions are made in the best interests of child;adoptions are made in the best interests of child;
adopted children have not been sold, trafficked or abducted from their parents; andadopted children have not been sold, trafficked or abducted from their parents; and

"I’ve done the necessary paperwork, I’m a citizen or permanent resident of good standing, and I went through a reputable adoption agency. Why is my adoption taking so long?","Intercountry adoption is a complex process. Canadian families planning to adopt a child in another country should understand that, even under ideal conditions, the process will take time. Depending on the child’s country of origin, it is not unusual for the entire process to take two years or even longer.Intercountry adoption procedures established by IRCC are intended to protect the child. These include evidence that the biological parents have given their free and informed consent to the adoption before it takes place, and confirmation that the adoption is in accordance with the laws of both countries.
  In some parts of the world, child trafficking is a serious concern, and documentation is non-existent or unreliable, or there is evidence of wrongdoing in the adoption system or limited infrastructure to support the protection of children.  In these cases, we must do additional verifications to ensure the child was not taken from, or sold by, their biological parents.
"
Do the criteria for permanent residence and for a grant of citizenship differ for adopted children?,"Yes. For an adopted  person to be eligible for a direct grant of citizenship for adopted persons at  least one of the adoptive parents must be a Canadian citizen at the time of the  adoption, or, for adoptions that took place prior to January 1, 1947, at least  one adoptive parent must have become a Canadian citizen on January 1, 1947 (or  April 1, 1949, in the case of Newfoundland and Labrador for adoptions that took  place prior to April 1, 1949) and be able to pass on Canadian citizenship to  the adopted person.

Both Canadian citizensCanadian citizens and permanent residentspermanent residents can use the immigration process  for their adopted children if the adopted person is going to live in Canada  right after the adoption.Another difference  between the two processes is the adopted child does not have to undergo a  medical exam or background checks when applying for a direct grant  of citizenship. These are   requirements when applying for permanent  residence.Where the  requirements are the same for both  types of applications, the adoption must:

How does adoption affect my child’s relationship with her or his biological parents?,"For both the immigration and citizenship process, an adoption is valid only if it ends the child’s legal relationship with the biological parents, and a new legal relationship is established between the adopting parents and the adopted child.This means the child cannot later sponsor his/her biological relatives to come to Canada."

Will my child automatically have the right to a Canadian passport once he or she gets citizenship?,"Yes.

"Should I apply for permanent residence for my adopted child, rather than Canadian citizenship?","Permanent residence might be better suited to some people than citizenship. For example, some parents might want to let their adopted child choose to become a Canadian citizen as an adult, rather than decide on behalf of their child. That might be especially true if their adopted child is from a country that does not recognize multiple citizenships.Also, adoptees who become permanent residents before applying for citizenship will be able to:
pass on their citizenship to children they may later have abroad; orpass on their citizenship to children they may later have abroad; or

Why did processing times information change?,"Prior to December 31, 2015, processing times for many of our services were displayed by visa office. This was useful when applications for permanent or temporary residence were always processed by the nearest visa office. However, we now have the ability to move applications around our global network to ensure they are processed as efficiently as possible. This means your application may not be processed at the office closest to where you live. For many services, instead of asking about your nearest visa office, you are now asked for your country of residence. This provides you with a more accurate processing time. For other services, you may see a single processing time, no matter where you live. This is our commitment to process applications within that time. These processing times are updated on a weekly basis.In addition, we redesigned the layout to be mobile friendly so that you can get the information you need anytime, on any device."

You can consult the processing times toolprocessing times tool for details. This section is updated weekly, so check often to get the latest information."
How are processing times calculated?,"We calculate processing times from the day we receive an application to the day it makes a decision on the application.When estimating how long you will wait to receive a temporary visa, you must also take into account up to 10 days of transit or delivery time on top of our processing time. The time your application will spend travelling to and from IRCC will vary depending on where you live. "
Why do some application processing times change and others do not?,"This is normal because the volume of  applications may vary from one month to the next. Rest assured that files are still being  processed.In many cases, a file is waiting  in a queue for initial review. Applications are processed in the order in which  they arrive. Some take longer to process than others. There is no maximum time frame  for reviewing an application. "
Why are there differences in processing times among regions and offices?,"Visa offices face different challenges operating in different countries and regions, and even in different offices within the same region. Various factors can affect the time it takes to process applications, including:

However, to protect the child’s rights, international adoption must be a rigorous process.

adoptions are made in the best interests of child;adoptions are made in the best interests of child;

If you use another type of browser software, you should check with your software supplier to make sure that your browser has 128-bit secure sockets layer encryption capability.NoteNote: We are not responsible for any difficulties or problems in downloading and installing software. Software suppliers are responsible for providing technical support."
What does encryption mean and is it safe to use Client Application Status (CAS)?,“Encryption” is a way of covering important information with a code before it is sent over the Internet. That means other machines and people cannot read it illegally. Your computer does this automatically when you send certain personal information to Citizenship and Immigration Canada us. Your encrypted application information will be decoded once it reaches IRCC.
What is Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)?,"Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a secure way to transmit personal information from your computer to IRCC. SSLSSL uses encryption, which helps make information sent through the Internet more secure. Internet services like online banking or shopping—for which security of information is important—often use 128-bit SSLSSL encryption. When you access the personal information area of Client Application Status (CAS), IRCC will make sure your browser supports SSLSSL."

The application / profile details in my online account have changed. Why are the details different?,We updated the application / profile details to give you more information about the status of your application. Use the Help “?” symbol for more information on the new details.
Why did processing times information change?,"Prior to December 31, 2015, processing times for many of our services were displayed by visa office. This was useful when applications for permanent or temporary residence were always processed by the nearest visa office. However, we now have the ability to move applications around our global network to ensure they are processed as efficiently as possible. This means your application may not be processed at the office closest to where you live. For many services, instead of asking about your nearest visa office, you are now asked for your country of residence. This provides you with a more accurate processing time. For other services, you may see a single processing time, no matter where you live. This is our commitment to process applications within that time. These processing times are updated on a weekly basis.In addition, we redesigned the layout to be mobile friendly so that you can get the information you need anytime, on any device."
How long will it take to process my application?,"Processing times are difficult to predict. They vary depending on the type of applicationapplication you submit and the number of applications currently being processed.Please note that processing times change depending on the number of applications received and  may change during the processing of your application. You can consult the processing times toolprocessing times tool for details. This section is updated weekly, so check often to get the latest information."
How are processing times calculated?,"We calculate processing times from the day we receive an application to the day it makes a decision on the application.When estimating how long you will wait to receive a temporary visa, you must also take into account up to 10 days of transit or delivery time on top of our processing time. The time your application will spend travelling to and from IRCC will vary depending on where you live. "
Why do some application processing times change and others do not?,"This is normal because the volume of  applications may vary from one month to the next. Rest assured that files are still being  processed.In many cases, a file is waiting  in a queue for initial review. Applications are processed in the order in which  they arrive. Some take longer to process than others. There is no maximum time frame  for reviewing an application. "
Why are there differences in processing times among regions and offices?,"Visa offices face different challenges operating in different countries and regions, and even in different offices within the same region. Various factors can affect the time it takes to process applications, including:
the number of applications received;the number of applications received;
the resources at an office;the resources at an office;

How long will the adoption process take?,"Adopting a child in another country takes time. Depending on the child’s country of origin, the process may take two years or longer.Adoption cases are processed on a priority basis.

Find out more about processing timesprocessing times.Long waits can seem unreasonable when you are anxious to welcome a new family member. However, to protect the child’s rights, international adoption must be a rigorous process. Both your provincial or territorial government in Canada, and the government of the country where the child lives, must approve the adoption.To ensure the child’s rights are protected, visa officers must be satisfied that:

It is expected that other Sign-In Partners will be added in the future. Keep checking the list of Sign-In Partners when you log in to access Government of Canada services."
Why is the Government of Canada offering users the option to use banking credentials?,"By offering a choice of credentials, the government is making its online services more convenient for clients to access. Many individuals use their online banking credentials regularly, so being able to use the same credential to access government services online means that you will have one less User ID and password to remember."
What are the advantages of using my online banking credentials?,"Your existing credentials, such as your online banking credentials, are familiar as you may already use them on a regular basis. Using your credential from one of the Sign-In Partners to access government services is convenient as you don’t have to remember a different user ID and password. The safeguarding of Canadians’ information online is a priority for the Government of Canada and measures have been put in place to ensure secure online access which respects privacy.  Remember that when you use a Sign-In Partner, none of your banking or personally identifiable information is communicated to the government service you are trying to access and the Government of Canada does not know which Sign-In Partner (or financial institution) you have used. Similarly, no information about the government service being accessed by the user will be shared with the user's Sign-in Partner."
Are the Banking Credentials as secure as the Government Credential?,"Yes,  the banking credentials are just as secure as the Government credential. The  same authentication process and security requirements are used whether you choose  to use your banking credential through SecureKey Concierge or the  government-issued credential service called GCKey. The authentication process does not carry any personally identifiable  information such as name, birth date etc. It relies on strong technology, built using  industry best practices. By offering you the choice of using a banking  credential, the Government of Canada is leveraging the investments made by  financial institutions in secure online environments. "
Is any of my banking information shared if I use Sign-In Partner (SecureKey Concierge)?,"No, your banking information is not shared when you use a Sign-In Partner.The technology is designed in such a way that the Government of Canada will not know which Sign-In Partner (or financial institution) you have used. Similarly, the bank will not know which government department or agency its customer contacted. Also, the credential broker who facilitates this interaction will not know the identity of the individual or business. The participating financial institutions and departments and agencies will not share any information that identifies individuals, as directed under privacy legislation."
I don’t bank with any of the financial institutions listed. What alternative do I have when I want to access government services online?,"If you don’t have a credential with one of the Sign-In Partners, you can use the government-issued credential, GCKeyGCKey.It is expected that other Sign-In Partners will be added in the future, so keep checking the list of Sign-In Partnersthe list of Sign-In Partners when you log in to access Government of Canada services."
"I bank with one of the banks on your list, but I’m not registered for online banking. How do I access MyCIC using Sign-In Partner (SecureKey Concierge)?","To log in using a Sign-In Partner, you must be registered with your financial institution for online banking access. Your bank can assist you in registering online."

Will the bank charge me for using my banking credential to access government services?,NoNo. This is part of the service your bank offers its customers.
Will I still be able to use GCKey even if I decided to use my online banking credentials once?,"Yes, if you wish to do so, you can use a different credential to access different Government of Canada services.

It is expected that other Sign-In Partners will be added in the future. Keep checking the list of Sign-In Partners when you log in to access Government of Canada services."
Why is the Government of Canada offering users the option to use banking credentials?,"By offering a choice of credentials, the government is making its online services more convenient for clients to access. Many individuals use their online banking credentials regularly, so being able to use the same credential to access government services online means that you will have one less User ID and password to remember."
What are the advantages of using my online banking credentials?,"Your existing credentials, such as your online banking credentials, are familiar as you may already use them on a regular basis. Using your credential from one of the Sign-In Partners to access government services is convenient as you don’t have to remember a different user ID and password. The safeguarding of Canadians’ information online is a priority for the Government of Canada and measures have been put in place to ensure secure online access which respects privacy.  Remember that when you use a Sign-In Partner, none of your banking or personally identifiable information is communicated to the government service you are trying to access and the Government of Canada does not know which Sign-In Partner (or financial institution) you have used. Similarly, no information about the government service being accessed by the user will be shared with the user's Sign-in Partner."
Are the Banking Credentials as secure as the Government Credential?,"Yes,  the banking credentials are just as secure as the Government credential. The  same authentication process and security requirements are used whether you choose  to use your banking credential through SecureKey Concierge or the  government-issued credential service called GCKey. The authentication process does not carry any personally identifiable  information such as name, birth date etc. It relies on strong technology, built using  industry best practices. By offering you the choice of using a banking  credential, the Government of Canada is leveraging the investments made by  financial institutions in secure online environments. "
Is any of my banking information shared if I use Sign-In Partner (SecureKey Concierge)?,"No, your banking information is not shared when you use a Sign-In Partner.The technology is designed in such a way that the Government of Canada will not know which Sign-In Partner (or financial institution) you have used. Similarly, the bank will not know which government department or agency its customer contacted. Also, the credential broker who facilitates this interaction will not know the identity of the individual or business. The participating financial institutions and departments and agencies will not share any information that identifies individuals, as directed under privacy legislation."
I don’t bank with any of the financial institutions listed. What alternative do I have when I want to access government services online?,"If you don’t have a credential with one of the Sign-In Partners, you can use the government-issued credential, GCKeyGCKey.It is expected that other Sign-In Partners will be added in the future, so keep checking the list of Sign-In Partnersthe list of Sign-In Partners when you log in to access Government of Canada services."
"I bank with one of the banks on your list, but I’m not registered for online banking. How do I access MyCIC using Sign-In Partner (SecureKey Concierge)?","To log in using a Sign-In Partner, you must be registered with your financial institution for online banking access. Your bank can assist you in registering online."

Will the bank charge me for using my banking credential to access government services?,NoNo. This is part of the service your bank offers its customers.
Will I still be able to use GCKey even if I decided to use my online banking credentials once?,"Yes, if you wish to do so, you can use a different credential to access different Government of Canada services.

It is expected that other Sign-In Partners will be added in the future. Keep checking the list of Sign-In Partners when you log in to access Government of Canada services."
Why is the Government of Canada offering users the option to use banking credentials?,"By offering a choice of credentials, the government is making its online services more convenient for clients to access. Many individuals use their online banking credentials regularly, so being able to use the same credential to access government services online means that you will have one less User ID and password to remember."
What are the advantages of using my online banking credentials?,"Your existing credentials, such as your online banking credentials, are familiar as you may already use them on a regular basis. Using your credential from one of the Sign-In Partners to access government services is convenient as you don’t have to remember a different user ID and password. The safeguarding of Canadians’ information online is a priority for the Government of Canada and measures have been put in place to ensure secure online access which respects privacy.  Remember that when you use a Sign-In Partner, none of your banking or personally identifiable information is communicated to the government service you are trying to access and the Government of Canada does not know which Sign-In Partner (or financial institution) you have used. Similarly, no information about the government service being accessed by the user will be shared with the user's Sign-in Partner."
Are the Banking Credentials as secure as the Government Credential?,"Yes,  the banking credentials are just as secure as the Government credential. The  same authentication process and security requirements are used whether you choose  to use your banking credential through SecureKey Concierge or the  government-issued credential service called GCKey. The authentication process does not carry any personally identifiable  information such as name, birth date etc. It relies on strong technology, built using  industry best practices. By offering you the choice of using a banking  credential, the Government of Canada is leveraging the investments made by  financial institutions in secure online environments. "
Is any of my banking information shared if I use Sign-In Partner (SecureKey Concierge)?,"No, your banking information is not shared when you use a Sign-In Partner.The technology is designed in such a way that the Government of Canada will not know which Sign-In Partner (or financial institution) you have used. Similarly, the bank will not know which government department or agency its customer contacted. Also, the credential broker who facilitates this interaction will not know the identity of the individual or business. The participating financial institutions and departments and agencies will not share any information that identifies individuals, as directed under privacy legislation."
I don’t bank with any of the financial institutions listed. What alternative do I have when I want to access government services online?,"If you don’t have a credential with one of the Sign-In Partners, you can use the government-issued credential, GCKeyGCKey.It is expected that other Sign-In Partners will be added in the future, so keep checking the list of Sign-In Partnersthe list of Sign-In Partners when you log in to access Government of Canada services."
"I bank with one of the banks on your list, but I’m not registered for online banking. How do I access MyCIC using Sign-In Partner (SecureKey Concierge)?","To log in using a Sign-In Partner, you must be registered with your financial institution for online banking access. Your bank can assist you in registering online."
I would rather not use Sign-In Partner (SecureKey Concierge) to access MyCIC. What are my options?,"You can use GCKeyGCKey, a government-issued credential, to access Government of Canada online services."
Will the bank charge me for using my banking credential to access government services?,NoNo. This is part of the service your bank offers its customers.
Will I still be able to use GCKey even if I decided to use my online banking credentials once?,"Yes, if you wish to do so, you can use a different credential to access different Government of Canada services.

What do you mean by authentication?,"It is a secure means to recognize a user when accessing government services online. The user remains anonymous, and the authentication process just confirms that the credential is valid and is in the hands of the owner of the credential. Credential authentication does not reveal or confirm identity to the government website. It receives only a message confirming that your credential (username/password) was successfully validated by your bank or by the government."
I had to switch my electronic log-in credentials not that long ago. Why are you changing it again?,"The Government of Canada has been using a phased approach to authentication services. Access Key was an interim step while the Government of Canada was putting in place new, cost-effective solutions which would provide improved user choice and convenience, securely."
Can I still use my Access Key?,"NoNo. As of November 3, 2012November 3, 2012, you will need to use either GCKeyGCKey or Sign-In Partner (SecureKey Concierge) to access IRCC online services."

Why did you change the number of points for a valid job offer in Express Entry?,"By awarding additional points for a job offer based on the NOC, we can get a better balance of top talent from the pool.This means that if you have a high CRS score for your skills and experience alone, you are more likely to be invited to apply.For a valid job offervalid job offer under Express Entry, you can now get:
200 CRS points for NOC 00 jobs200 CRS points for NOC 00 jobs
50 CRS points for any other NOC 0, A and B jobs.50 CRS points for any other NOC 0, A and B jobs.
We used to award 600 points for a valid job offer. This changed on November 19, 2016.Those points caused the system to place too much weight on job offers. This made it hard for highly skilled people without job offers, who we want in our economy, to be invited to apply.This change will better recognize both a person’s skills and experience with the value they bring to the economy."
