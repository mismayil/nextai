        1. What is Express Entry?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         Express Entry is an electronic management application system for immigration to Canada.
It is not an immigration program. Rather, it facilitates the selection and processing of Canada’s economic immigration programs:

the Federal Skilled Worker Class (formerly the Federal Skilled Worker Program),
the Federal Skilled Trades Class (formerly the Federal Skilled Trades Program), 
the Canadian Experience Class, and
a portion of the Provincial Nominee Programs. 

Applicants make an "expression of interest" (EOI) in immigrating to Canada and, if they are eligible for at least one of the aforementioned programs, they then enter the Express Entry pool. The federal government and provincial governments, as well as Canadian employers, are then able to select candidates from this pool who will then receive an Invitation To Apply (ITA) for immigration to Canada under one of the programs. Express Entry moves Canada from a first come, first served (or supply-driven) system to an invitation to apply (or demand-driven) system. Modelled on similar systems in use in Australia and New Zealand, Express Entry aims to fast track the processing of skilled immigrants deemed most likely to succeed in Canada.

        2. Why is it called Express Entry?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly known as CIC) aims to process applications within six months from the date of submission, hence the name Express Entry.
Note that this does not mean six months from the date a candidate made an expression of interest in immigrating to Canada, but rather six months from the date he or she submits a complete application for permanent residence after an invitation to apply has been issued.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The Express Entry system applies to the following Canadian economic immigration programs:

the Federal Skilled Worker Class,
the Federal Skilled Trades Class, 
the Canadian Experience Class, and
a portion of the Provincial Nominee Programs. 

Provinces and territories are able to recruit candidates from the Express Entry system for a portion of the Provincial Nominee Programs in order to meet local labour market needs.

        5. Does Express Entry change the requirements of Canadian immigration programs?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        No. Express Entry does not change Canadian immigration program requirement. Express Entry is not an immigration program. Rather, it is a management and selection system for existing immigration programs.

        6. What is an Express Entry profile?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         Potential candidates make an expression of interest (EOI) in coming to Canada by creating an Express Entry profile and providing information about their skills, work experience, language ability, education, and other personal information. This profile is self-declared; that is to say that the material provided by the potential candidate is based on his or her own assessment of his or her personal information.

        7. What happens if the personal information declared by a potential candidate going into the pool turns out to be false?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         If the information provided by the potential candidate turns out to be false, this is known as misrepresentation and, depending on the nature and severity of the false claim, carries penalties. A potential candidate who has been found to have provided false information going into the Express Entry pool can be banned from re-entering the pool for five years. Therefore, it is hugely important to provide accurate and correct information always. Candidates who are unsure about how to assess their own abilities and credentials may want to seek advice from an immigration lawyer before entering the Express Entry pool.

        8. What is the Express Entry pool?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         Potential candidates who create an Express Entry profile and are eligible for one of Canada’s economic immigration programs enter the Express Entry pool. These programs are the Federal Skilled Worker Class, the Federal Skilled Trades Class, the Canadian Experience Class, and a portion of the Provincial Nominee Programs. The federal government and provincial governments, as well as Canadian employers, are able to select candidates from this pool. Candidates who are selected then receive an ‘Invitation to Apply’ (ITA) for immigration to Canada under one of the programs.

        10. What is the Comprehensive Ranking System?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        
The Comprehensive Ranking System is the government of Canada’s internal mechanism for ranking candidates bases on their human capital, determined by factors such as age, level of education and language ability. This helps to enable Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly known as CIC) to decide which candidates may be issued invitations to apply for permanent residence. There are up to 600 points available under the system for a candidate's core human capital and skills transferability factors. Up to 600 additional points are available for additional factors (including a provincial nomination, an offer of arranged employment, and/or prior Canadian study experience).
NOTE: On June 6, 2017, the government of Canada introduced changes to the Comprehensive Ranking System, introducing additional points for candidates, and their accompanying spouses/common-law partners if applicable, who have a sibling in Canada, and/or who have French language ability.

        11. What is the Canada Job Bank, and what role does it have under Express Entry?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         The Canada Job Bank is an online search engine for open job positions across Canada. It helps match candidates with Canadian employers and jobs based on their skills, knowledge, and experience. Under Express Entry, candidates may register with the Job Bank if they do not already have a Canadian job offer or a Provincial/Territorial nomination. As of June 6, 2017, registration in the Job Bank is voluntary.
If a candidate is currently working in Canada on a Labour Market Impact Assessment-based work permit, he or she will not have to reapply for a new LMIA, insofar as the LMIA is still valid. Should the Express Entry candidate choose to apply to a job opportunity, the recipient employer will then be required to go through their usual interview or assessment process. If the employer finds that the Express Entry candidate meets their needs, and they are eligible to hire a foreign national, they can offer them a job. Employers with a positive LMIA will then provide this information along with a job offer letter to the candidate to include in their Express Entry profile. A Canadian job offer awards points under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), and consequently may increase a candidate's chances of receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence in a subsequent draw from the Express Entry pool.

        12. Once a candidate is in the pool, can he or she change the information on his or her profile?

        13. What does ‘invitation to apply’ mean?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         An Invitation to Apply (ITA) is offered to any candidate in the Express Entry pool who has been selected to apply for immigration to Canada by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). A candidate who receives an ITA will have meet the requirements in one of IRCC’s draws from the pool. This includes meeting the minimum Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) cut-off threshold for that draw.

        14. Does a candidate with more points have a better chance of being invited to apply for permanent residence than a candidate with fewer points, even though both candidates are eligible to enter the Express Entry pool?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         Whereas previously potential candidates who were eligible for a Canadian immigration program could apply directly to that program, that is no longer the case. Under Express Entry, candidates with higher points totals in the Express Entry pool may have a better chance of being invited to apply for Canadian permanent residence by either the federal government, a Canadian province or territory, or a Canadian employer. Highly educated candidates with skilled work experience and strong language skills in English and/or French, for example, are likely obtain a greater number of points than those who do not possess these qualities.

        Yes, the federal government of Canada is able to select candidates from the Express Entry pool. These candidates do not necessarily need to have a valid job offer from a Canadian employer in order to receive an Invitation to Apply for permanent residence.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        There are no eligible occupation lists for any of the programs. Under previous versions of the Federal Skilled Worker Class, there were lists of eligible occupations deemed in demand by the government of Canada. Under the most recent version of the Canadian Experience Class, there was a list of ineligible occupations. These lists are no more. It must be noted, however, that in order to be eligible for any of the programs under Express Entry, the candidate needs to have work experience in an occupation that has a National Occupation Classification (NOC) code of skill type 0, A or B.

        20. How do provinces and territories use the Express Entry system?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         All provinces and territories, except for Quebec, Alberta and Nunavut, currently use Express Entry. Provinces and territories are able to nominate a certain number of candidates through the Express Entry system to meet their local and provincial labour market needs. These are known as "enhanced" nominations. If an applicant gets an enhanced nomination from a province or territory, he or she is then given 600 additional points under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) and will receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence at a subsequent draw from the pool. All candidates must meet the eligibility criteria of one of the federal economic immigration programs in order to enter and be selected from the Express Entry pool.
Just as they manage their own Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs), provinces and territories set the criteria they use to nominate Express Entry candidates. Depending on the province/territory, Express Entry candidates may either enter the pool first and then be nominated by a province or territory, or be nominated by a province or territory and then complete an online Express Entry profile. Provinces and territories are also able to make nominations under their regular (“base”) PNPs outside the Express Entry system.

        21. Can candidates use both a Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) and Express Entry?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes, there is a connection between the PNPs and Express Entry. Once a candidate updates his or her Express Entry profile to show that he or she has an enhanced provincial nomination certificate, he or she will be given enough additional points (600) to be invited to apply at a subsequent draw of candidates from the pool.
Candidates must be in the pool before applying to a province or territory for an enhanced provincial nomination certificate, or submitting an Expression of Interest to a province or territory under one of the enhanced PNP streams.

        22. What role do Canadian employers play under Express Entry?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Canadian employers have a greater and more direct role in Canadian immigration under Express Entry than previously. Candidates in the Express Entry pool have the opportunity to increase their chances of being invited to apply by promoting themselves directly to employers through the Canada Job Bank. As of June 6, 2017, registration in the Job Bank is voluntary.
Once a candidate obtains a job offer supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) — which serves as proof that the employer made efforts to employ Canadian citizens and permanent residents for the position — he or she obtains 50 or 200 additional points, depending on the level of the job offered.
In addition, certain work permit holders may be awarded points for their job offer even if they have not obtained a LMIA:

Individuals with a work permit issued under an international agreement, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Individuals with a work permit issued under the ‘significant benefits to Canada’ criteria, such as Intra-Company Transfers.

In both above cases, the worker must have been working in Canada for at least one year and the job offer must be made by the same employer named on the work permit.

        Not necessarily, though the fact that Canadian employers play a greater role in Canadian immigration under Express Entry than they did previously means that, for many candidates, obtaining a valid job offer from a Canadian employer significantly increases their chances of being invited to apply for Canadian permanent residence. Candidates in the Express Entry pool have the opportunity to increase their chances of being invited to apply by promoting themselves directly to employers through the CanadaVisa Job Search tool.

        From the moment a candidate is issued an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for Canadian permanent residence, he or she has 90 days to submit a complete electronic application with all supporting documents. Because of this limited time period, candidates are encouraged to begin collecting these documents and ensuring they are in good order before an ITA is issued. If a candidate misses the 90-day deadline, the ITA that was issued to him or her is no longer valid and he or she will have to re-enter the Express Entry pool. If the information provided by the potential candidate turns out to be false, this is known as misrepresentation and, depending on the nature and severity of the false claim, carries penalties. A potential candidate who has been found to have provided false information going into the Express Entry pool can be banned from re-entering the pool for five years.

        Candidates should bear in mind that the economic immigration programs that have been in place in recent years remain in place under the Express Entry selection system. Once an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence has been issued to a candidate, he or she must submit a range of supporting document with his or her application, as was the case previously. These documents include those pertaining to civil status such as marriage certificates (if applicable), birth certificates, language test results, an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA; if applicable), work reference letters, security background checks, and other documents.

        An ECA is required for candidates in the Express Entry pool who wish to be considered for draws related to the Federal Skilled Worker Class, unless they received their post-secondary education in Canada. For candidates who are hoping to apply to the Federal Skilled Trades Class or Canadian Experience Class, an ECA is optional but may increase the points they receive on the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) and improve their chances of being drawn from the pool.

        27. Do candidates need to take language tests?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes, all candidates need to take a language test in order to determine their language abilities. There are a set number of points available for language ability for each of the economic immigration programs that come under Express Entry, and ability must be proven by candidates taking a standardized language test approved by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly known as CIC). The most popular are IELTS for English and TEF for French.
As part of their Express Entry profile, candidates must submit valid language test results obtained in the past two years. Once a candidate enters the Express Entry pool, he or she can earn extra points and increase his or her rank by taking another language test and obtaining better results. As of June 6, 2017, additional points are also available to candidates who prove French language ability in addition to English language ability. Candidates can practice IELTS before taking the test.

        Candidates know their points total (or score), but do not know their rank within the pool. They do, however, know the minimum score that was required for the most recent draw from the Express Entry pool. Therefore, they have a target that they can aim to meet and surpass in order to increase their chances of being invited to apply for permanent residence.

         Candidates who receive an invitation to apply for permanent residence from a Canadian province or territory should have the intention to reside in that particular province or territory. The Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) are set up to address local and regional labour market needs, and so it follows that candidates invited to apply through a PNP are deemed likely to succeed in that particular province or territory. Once a candidate has landed in Canada, however, he or she will have the right to freedom of movement within Canada, as well as the right to live and work anywhere in Canada for any employer.

        A successful applicant can bring his or her spouse (i.e. husband or wife) or common-law partner, as well as dependent children, to Canada. In the case of married couples and common-law partners, only one of the partners needs to receive an invitation to apply for permanent residence. The spouse or common-law partner of the principal applicant, as well as any children under the age of 19 (at the time the application is received), also receive a permanent resident visa. A spouse must submit language test results and security background checks. A spouse and all dependent children, as well as the principal applicant, must pass a medical examination.
Note: The government of Canada has announced that as of October 24, 2017, the maximum age of dependent children who may be included on an application will increase to under 22 years of age (at the time the application is received).

        Yes, candidates are able to promote themselves to Canadian employers online, as well as network, to increase their chances of obtaining a qualifying job offer. Candidates who are successful in obtaining a qualifying offer of arranged employment job offer supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) are awarded 50 or 200 points under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), depending on the level of the job offered.
In order to meet the conditions of a qualifying offer of arranged employment, in most cases the job offer must be supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). In addition, certain work permit holders may be awarded points for their job offer even if they have not obtained a LMIA:

Individuals with a work permit issued under an international agreement, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Individuals with a work permit issued under the ‘significant benefits to Canada’ criteria, such as Intra-Company Transfers.

In both above cases, the worker must have been working in Canada for at least one year and the job offer must be made by the same employer named on the work permit.

        37. Is Express Entry the only way for an international worker to live and work in Canada?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         No. Express Entry facilitates the processing of economic immigrants for Canadian permanent residence. There are, however, a number of other ways of moving to Canada, both permanent and temporary.

Only a portion of the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) are processed through Express Entry. Other PNP candidates will be able to apply to these programs directly if they are eligible under the requirements, which are based on local and regional labour market needs. Most PNP streams require the candidate to secure a valid job offer before immigrating to Canada, but there are some exceptions. Successful candidates will land in Canada as permanent residents.
Candidates for certain employment opportunities in Canada may arrive as temporary foreign workers. In most cases, this will require the processing of a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA).
There are several instances where an employer may be exempt from the requirement to secure an LMIA. Some countries have established international exchange programs with Canada, with candidates typically needing to be younger than 30 or 35, depending on nationality. Successful applicants receive a temporary open work permit.
Coming to Canada to study is a popular option for those who wish to continue their education at one of Canada’s many renowned colleges and universities. On completion of the studies, some provinces facilitate the option for the graduate to apply for permanent residence under a PNP or, in the case of Quebec, the Quebec Experience Class (Programme de l’expérience québécoise, or PEQ). Another option for graduates wishing to remain in Canada after completing their studies is to obtain a Post-Graduation Work Permit and ultimately apply for permanent residence.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        An applicant may have a birthday after he or she receives an Invitation to Apply (ITA)  but before he or she submits an application for permanent residence. A change in age may lower his or her Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score below the lowest score in the draw. It may also result in the applicant no longer meeting the minimum requirements. When a change in age results in the candidate no longer meeting the minimum entry criteria or lowering his or her CRS points score below the lowest points score in the draw, IRCC officers are asked to apply the public policy to exempt applicants for permanent residence from certain age-based requirements between ITA and application. This public policy also grants an exemption to applicants who may be refused on Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) program requirements for having a birthday between receiving an ITA and submitting an application. In short, a candidate's age may be considered locked in once an invitation to apply has been issued.

        41. Are candidates required to hire an immigration representative under Express Entry?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         Candidates are not required to hire an immigration representative in order to participate in Express Entry. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly known as CIC) has determined, however, that authorized immigration representatives may assist candidates during all stages of the Express Entry immigration process. With over 35 years of success, lawyer David Cohen and his professional team at Campbell Cohen can help candidates immigrate to Canada by:

Helping to prepare an accurate application going into the pool, lessening the risk of misrepresentation and the associated penalties;
Providing job alerts related to the candidate’s occupation and promoting the candidate to Canadian employers. This increases his or her chances of landing a skilled job and being invited to apply for permanent residency; and
Reviewing all supporting documents, submitting an application within the time frame set by the government of Canada, and tracking it all the way while communicating with the government on the candidate’s behalf. Potential candidates can fill out an online assessment form today and maximize their chances of success in immigrating to Canada under the Express Entry immigration selection system.

        1. What is Express Entry?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Express Entry is a new electronic management application system for immigration to Canada.
It is not an immigration program. Rather, it facilitates the selection and processing of the following Canadian economic immigration programs:

the Federal Skilled Worker Class (formerly the Federal Skilled Worker Program),
the Federal Skilled Trades Class (formerly the Federal Skilled Trades Program), 
the Canadian Experience Class, and
a portion of the Provincial Nominee Programs. 

Applicants make an "expression of interest" (EOI) in immigrating to Canada and, if they are eligible for at least one of the aforementioned programs, they then enter the Express Entry pool. The federal government and provincial governments, as well as Canadian employers, are then able to select candidates from this pool who will then receive an Invitation To Apply (ITA) for immigration to Canada under one of the programs.
Express Entry moves Canada from a first come, first served (or supply-driven) system to an invitation to apply (or demand-driven) system. Modelled on similar systems in use in Australia and New Zealand, Express Entry aims to fast track the processing of skilled immigrants deemed most likely to succeed in Canada.

        2. Why is it called Express Entry?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) aims to process applications within six months from the date of submission, hence the name Express Entry.

        4. What role do Canadian employers play under Express Entry?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Under Express Entry, Canadian employers have a more direct role in Canadian immigration than before. Candidates in the Express Entry pool have the opportunity to increase their chances of being invited to apply by promoting themselves directly to employers through the Canada Job Bank, and by other means. Together with the federal government and Canadian provinces, Canadian employers are able to select candidates who have made an expression of interest in immigrating to Canada.

        5. Once an employer selects a candidate from the Express Entry pool, who pays for the immigration process from that point?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Canadian employers have no obligation to pay any government fees relating to the processing of a candidate’s immigration. This matter may be decided between an employer and a candidate.

        6. If an employer selects a candidate, what happens in the event that the employer later wishes, for whatever reason, to terminate his or her employment?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The process of termination of employment is the same as for any permanent resident or Canadian citizen already residing in Canada. Relevant labour laws apply.

        7. What is the Comprehensive Ranking System?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) is the government of Canada’s internal mechanism for ranking candidates based on their human capital, determined by factors such as age, level of education, and language ability. This helps to enable Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to decide which candidates may be issued invitations to apply for permanent residence.

        8. Does an employer have to make a permanent job offer to a potential candidate in order to select him or her from the Express Entry pool?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        No. If an employer wishes to hire an international candidate through the Express Entry selection system, the job offer must be for a term of least one year after the issuance of the permanent resident visa. Please see question 10 to learn more.

        9. Does a candidate need a job offer in order to immigrate to Canada under Express Entry?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Not necessarily, though the fact that Canadian employers now play a significant role in Canadian immigration under Express Entry means that, for many candidates, obtaining a valid job offer from a Canadian employer can increase their chances of being invited to apply for Canadian permanent residence.

        10. Is there a faster way to fill an open position?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes, employers can explore other options for filling open positions with international workers. In most cases, Canadian employers wishing to hire a foreign worker first receive government approval before the hiring can take place. This approval comes in the form of a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), formerly known as a Labour Market Opinion (LMO).
There are several cases, however, where the need for a LMIA is waived. International agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) allow for the admission to Canada of certain foreign workers. Others include certain intra-company transferees, workers participating in International Exchange Programs, certain academics, and the dependants of temporary foreign workers who have obtained an LMIA.
In other cases, the Canadian government employee reviewing an application must determine that the hiring of a foreign worker will have a positive or neutral effect on the Canadian labour market. Among other factors, it must be clear that no qualified Canadians were passed up in favour of the foreign worker, and that the foreign worker will be given a salary and benefits that meet federal and provincial standards.
LMIAs will be provided within a 10-business-day service standard for workers in the following occupational categories:

Highest-demand occupations: The 10-day service standard for this category is limited to the skilled trades where wage offered is at or above the provincial/territorial median wage. These positions are essential to the development of major infrastructure and natural resource extraction projects, and are therefore considered vital to Canadian economic growth.
Highest-paid occupations: The 10-day service standard for this category is limited to employers hiring temporary foreign workers in the highest-paid occupations that offer wages in the top 10 percent of wages earned by Canadians in a given province or territory, such as physicians. This wage level indicated that a temporary foreign worker is the highest-skilled in their occupation, and that those skills are difficult to find in the Canadian labour market.
Shortest-duration occupations: The 10-day service standard for this category is limited to employers requesting temporary foreign workers for a short duration, defined as 120 calendar days or less, in any occupation where the wage offered is at or above the provincial or territorial median wage. Positions falling under this category include those related to repairs or manufacturing equipment and warranting work.

After receiving a positive LMIA, the employer should send a copy to their identified foreign worker. The positive LMIA must be included in the worker’s application for a Temporary Work Permit.
Note that in addition to LMIA holders, the following candidates in the Express Entry pool may also be awarded Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points for a qualifying job offer:

Individuals with a work permit issued under an international agreement, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Individuals with a work permit issued under the ‘significant benefits to Canada’ criteria, such as Intra-Company Transfers.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes, though once a candidate has been identified by the employer and the employer wishes to make a permanent job offer, the candidate must create an Express Entry profile and be issued an invitation to apply for permanent residence once the job offer has been formally submitted.
Employers can also recruit internationally outside the Express Entry pool and then bring a foreign worker to Canada temporarily. Please refer to question 10.

        14. If an employer wishes to hire a candidate through Express Entry, does the employer have to pay $1,000 for the processing of a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), as is the case for hiring a temporary foreign worker?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        No, there is no fee for permanent residence LMIAs.
Employers should balance the advantages of there being no fee for LMIAs processed through Express Entry against the reality that if they were to process an LMIA through the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (which carries a $1,000 fee), the worker may be able to begin working in Canada sooner.

         Employers can access candidates:

through their current recruiting and hiring practices, including private sector job boards; or
through the Job Bank, which will help match candidates with eligible employers in Canada and jobs based on their skills, knowledge, and experience.

In some cases employers can also work with provinces and territories through the respective nominee programs.

        In many cases, employers will need a positive LMIA. An employer may use an existing LMIA to hire their temporary foreign worker permanently, provided that LMIA is still valid.
Note that in addition to LMIA holders, the following candidates in the Express Entry pool may also be awarded Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points for a qualifying job offer:

Individuals with a work permit issued under an international agreement, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Individuals with a work permit issued under the ‘significant benefits to Canada’ criteria, such as Intra-Company Transfers.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Once a candidate has landed in Canada, he or she becomes a permanent resident and thus has the same employment rights as Canadian workers, protection under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and relevant labour laws. In short, he or she will have the same freedom to change employment enjoyed by Canadian citizens and permanent residents already residing in Canada.

        20. If so [to the above question], what safeguards can an employer put in place to avoid this?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Beyond the existing provincial labour laws already in place, there are no new additional rules in this regard. Employers can use their existing means of attracting and retaining skilled employees, such as ensuring that the contracts offered to candidates with valid job offer contain non-compete clauses, in order to mitigate the risk of an employee leaving his or her new job in Canada shortly after immigrating. Once an international worker lands in Canada and becomes a permanent resident, he or she has freedom of movement and may work for any employer across Canada.

        The Employer Liaison Network (ELN) helps employers navigate the Express Entry system. It provides employers with useful information on economic immigration programs and policies related to Express Entry. Its goal is to increase employer awareness and use of the Express Entry system, as well as to facilitate matches between Canadian employers and skilled workers. The ELN does not address case-specific inquiries or work permit issues. Its focus is on the permanent resident streams. There is no cost for using the ELN.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Canada accepts Skilled Workers based upon their ability to become economically established in Canada. If the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer believes that the point total does not accurately reflect a candidate's ability to become economically established in Canada, the officer may choose to use his or her positive discretion, referred to as substituted evaluation, and accept the application even though the candidate did not meet the minimum points requirement. Substituted evaluation requires the concurrence of a second designated officer and may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Officers may consider any relevant factors. The fact that an applicant “almost met” the requirements of the Federal Skilled Worker Class is not, in itself, sufficient grounds to recommend the use of positive substituted evaluation.

        Yes. Canada accepts Skilled Workers based upon their ability to become economically established in Canada. If the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer concludes that you will not become economically established in Canada, the Visa Officer may use his or her negative discretion (referred to as substituted evaluation) and refuse an application even though the applicant scored 67 or more points. Moreover, an applicant may be inadmissible to Canada due to health or security issues, no matter how many points are rewarded under the Skilled Worker Category.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        An offer of employment is not required in order to qualify under the Skilled Worker category of Canadian immigration. Arranged Employment, however, may be a determining factor in a candidate's eligibility to enter the Express Entry pool. Moreover, candidates with a qualifying job offer of arranged employment supported by a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) are awarded 600 points under the Comprehensive Ranking System and will be invited to apply for permanent residence at a subsequent draw from the pool.
NOTE: The government of Canada has stated that changes to the Comprehensive Ranking System will come into force on November 19, 2016. As of that date, points awarded for job offers will change, and certain regulations regarding LMIAs will also change. To learn more about this and other changes, click here.

        At a minimum, a candidate must have one year of full-time (or part-time equivalent) of continuous work experience in an occupation at a skill level recognized by IRCC. Accumulated part-time work experience is acceptable. It is assessed in proportion to a standard full-time working week of 37.5 hours. For example, a two-year part-time position requiring approximately 20 hours of work each week, will be counted as approximately one year of full-time experience.

         Applicants for a Canada Immigration Visa under the Skilled Worker category may be required to attend a personal interview with a Canadian Immigration Visa Officer. Such interviews are held to ensure the information in the application is accurate, to clear up any uncertainties and to verify information.
Canadian Immigration Visa Officers may, under all categories of immigration, grant an interview waiver, depending on the qualifications of the applicant, the quality of the supporting documentation, and the overall credibility of the applicant.

         Applications that are complete in every detail increase the chances of an interview waiver. Interview waivers, however, are granted at the discretion of the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer in charge of a candidate's file. It is not possible to apply specifically for a waiver. Even if an interview is waived, the Canadian Immigration Visa Officer reserves the right to call a candidate to an interview at a later date.

         The Provincial Nominee Programs were established by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly CIC) to allow Canada's different provinces and territories to select individuals who indicate an interest in settling in a particular province/territory and who will be able to contribute to that province/territory's economic development.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         No. Quebec has a separate agreement with the Government of Canada, which allows the province to select individuals who indicate a desire to reside in that province. The government of Quebec is the only provincial government with the authority to determine the selection of individuals outside of the Provincial Nominee Program. Quebec has its own immigration selection criteria.

        7. How do the Provincial Nominee Programs work with the Express Entry immigration selection system?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Provinces and territories are able to nominate a certain number of candidates through the Express Entry system to meet local and provincial labour market needs. These portions of the PNPs are known as “enhanced” nominations.
Candidates in the Express Entry pool who obtain an enhanced nomination from a province are awarded 600 points under the Comprehensive Ranking System, out of a possible total of 1,200. When these additional points are added to a candidate’s human capital and skills transferability points, it will result in an invitation to apply for permanent residence at a subsequent draw from the Express Entry pool.
All candidates must meet the eligibility criteria of one of the following federal economic immigration programs in order to enter and be selected from the Express Entry pool:

Federal Skilled Worker (FSW)
Federal Skilled Trades (FST)
Canadian Experience Class (CEC)

Provinces and territories may add additional criteria for their own immigration streams.
Depending on the province, candidates eligible to enter the Express Entry pool may either enter the pool first and then be nominated by a province or territory, or be nominated by a province or territory before completing an online Express Entry profile and entering the Express Entry pool. 
Note: As of November 19, 2016, changes will be made to the Comprehensive Ranking System. To learn more, click here.

        8. What is a "base" Provincial Nomination?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Provinces and territories are also able to make nominations under their regular, or “base”, PNPs outside the Express Entry system. Individuals who wish to immigrate to Canada, but who are not eligible to enter the Express Entry pool, may still be able to make an application to immigrate to Canada through a base PNP, as long as they are eligible for the provincial program. Base nominations may therefore provide Canadian immigration opportunities to individuals who are not eligible for Express Entry.
Candidates who receive a base nomination have their applications processed outside Express Entry. The route from a successful base nomination to permanent residence is a two-step process. Candidates must first satisfy the criteria for a PNP stream, apply, and receive a nomination certificate. With this certificate in hand, candidates may apply to the federal government for permanent resident status.

Close relations in that province
Ability to adapt to life in that province

        The Quebec Skilled Worker Program (QSWP) is an immigration program for candidates for economic immigration who intend to settle in the province of Quebec. The Ministère de l'immigration, de la diversité et de l'inclusion (Ministry of Immigration, Diversity, and Inclusion (MIDI)) receives applications to the QSWP through the online platform Mon Projet Québec. Applicants who are successful under the QSWP are issued a Quebec Selection Certificate (Certificat de sélection du Québec, or CSQ), which is required before the candidate applies to the Canadian federal government for a permanent residence visa.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The QSWP program is intended for prospective immigrants who wish to settle and build a life in Quebec. An application can be refused if the MIDI or the federal immigration authorities believe that the applicant does not intend to settle in Quebec. Once a successful applicant receives a permanent resident visa, he or she (and his or her family, if applicable) must land in Quebec upon arrival in Canada. However, it is important to note that immigrants who obtain permanent residence through the QSWP have the same rights as Canadian citizens and permanent residents in other provinces to move around the country freely and without impediment.

        Yes. An application can be refused at the federal processing stage for a variety of reasons. The decision to refuse an application at the federal level can be based on criminal background checks, or on the results of medical examinations. An application may also be refused if the federal immigration authorities have reason to believe any of the applicant's claims on their application are untrue, or if the authorities doubt the applicant's intention to reside in Quebec. If you have any concerns regarding criminal or medical inadmissibility to Canada, please contact us.

        21. If an applicant qualifies as a Quebec-Selected Skilled Worker and obtains a CSQ, does he or she then have to meet the points requirement for the Federal Skilled Worker Class?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        No. It is important to note that the selection criteria for a Quebec Skilled Worker are not the same as those for the Federal Skilled Worker Class. If an applicant obtains a CSQ, his or her application must still be submitted at the federal level for security and medical checks before permanent residence may be granted. However, qualifications are not re-assessed at the federal level, as the province will already have approved the qualifications and selected the applicant (and his or her family, if applicable) for immigration to Quebec.

        23. How is immigrating to Quebec different from immigrating to the rest of Canada?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Quebec is responsible for selecting immigrants to settle within the province. In order to immigrate to Quebec, candidates must first obtain a CSQ. It is important to note that a CSQ is not a Permanent Residence Visa. Once an application for a CSQ is submitted, candidates’ qualifications are assessed at the provincial level. After receiving approval at the provincial level (in the form of the CSQ), the candidate must submit an application at the federal level for medical and security checks. After a candidate is approved at the federal level, he or she receives permanent residence.

        24. Why are the requirements different for a CSQ than for a Federal Skilled Worker application?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Quebec is a culturally distinct province, and the only predominantly francophone province in Canada. A candidate’s chances of being selected by Quebec depend on his or her ability and willingness to settle and work in the province and adapt to life in the province. Quebec has had the right to define its own criteria for the selection of immigrants since 1991, when the province signed the Canada-Quebec Accord. This agreement between the provincial and federal governments came about in the context of rising separatist sentiment in Quebec, and although Quebec residents voted to remain part of Canada, the selection of immigrants according to Quebec's own criteria remains an important part of the province's identity. However, the right to move around Canada, as established in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, remains in the Canada-Quebec Accord.

Results of a recognized French test demonstrating at least a B2 level of oral French;
Final transcripts attesting to at least three years of secondary or post-secondary education completed entirely in French. If the course of study was completed in a country in which French is not the official language, a letter from the institution attesting that the applicant completed his or her studies entirely in French is also required to supplement the transcripts;
Final transcripts from an eligible French course taken in Quebec, in a recognized institution. This course can be at the secondary, college, or university level. The lists of recognized courses in 2016 can be found here:

        28. Can a work permit be extended if it expires before the federal processing stage for permanent residence is complete?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        To extend a work permit, the applicant would need to obtain a job offer from an employer. Such a job offer would be exempt from a Labour-Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) as the applicant has a CSQ. The applicant may then take the job offer and his or her CSQ to a Quebec Port of Entry to obtain a closed work permit for that employer. Applicants can only obtain a new or renewed work permit if they are currently residing in Quebec with a valid work permit. For a graduate applicant living in Quebec on a post-graduate work permit that will expire during the federal processing stage, the same applies. A post-graduate work permit cannot be extended beyond the length of the student’s period of study.

        If an applicant cannot renew his or her work permit before it expires, and he or she is not yet a permanent resident, he or she must apply to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to change to visitor status if he or she wishes to remain in Quebec as a visitor. Otherwise, the applicant can leave Canada until he or she obtains permanent residence status.

        If an application is returned to the applicant because it is incomplete, the applicant can resubmit the application again with the required additional documents. If the application is refused because the applicant does not meet the eligibility criteria, the applicant can submit an application to the Quebec Skilled Worker program if he or she meets the criteria for that program. Alternatively, if an applicant is refused because he or she does not meet the eligibility criteria, and the applicant later becomes eligible, the applicant can resubmit to the PEQ.

        Certain provinces have been given the authority by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to select or nominate candidates for immigration destined to their respective province under the Provincial Nominee Program.
Quebec has exclusive authority to select candidates who intend to reside in that province. These applicants are subject to Quebec's selection criteria, in addition to Federal medical and security clearance requirements. They must also pay an additional fee for processing by Quebec immigration authorities. Applicants who qualify under the Federal selection requirements may not necessarily satisfy Quebec's selection requirements, and vice versa.

Under the Immigrant Investor Venture Capital Pilot Program, the investment is only made once a candidate's application is approved. Information about the management of the fund, terms, and conditions, will be provided to immigrant investors in the agreement to be entered into with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly CIC). This agreement will have to be signed before applicants make their CAD $2 million at-risk (non-guaranteed) investment.
For individuals pursuing immigration through the Quebec Investor Program, you must commit your CAD $800,000 investment amount before final approval by Quebec immigration officials.

        That depends on the particular program.
Under the Immigrant Investor Venture Capital Pilot Program, applicants are only required to make an investment if their application is approved. Applicants who are approved under this program are required to make an investment in the Immigrant Investor Venture Capital Fund in the amount of CAD $2 million. The investment will be committed for approximately 15 years. This is an at-risk investment, therefore, it is a possibility that applicants will lose some or all of their investment. As with any venture capital investment, however, applicants also have the potential to receive proceeds, either over time or at the end of the investment term. Proceeds are dependent on the performance of the IIVC Fund.
Under the Quebec Investor Program, the investment of CAD $800,000 is guaranteed by the Quebec government and returned in full after five years.

        1. What is a Canada Immigration Visa?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        A Canada Immigration (Permanent Resident) Visa is a document which allows a person to live and work anywhere in Canada, and confers upon that person Permanent Resident status. It comes with certain responsibilities and may be revoked if the holder does not meet Canadian residency obligations, or is found guilty of serious criminal activity. A person who is a Canadian Permanent Resident may apply for Canadian citizenship after three years.

        2. How is a Work Permit different from a Canada Immigration Visa?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        A Work Permit allows an eligible individual to reside and work in Canada for a limited period of time, and restrictions are sometimes placed on the type of employment which can be pursued. It will not, by itself, lead to Canadian Permanent Residency, but can be a stepping stone to achieving this status. By contrast, a Canada Immigration Visa entitles its holder to live and work anywhere in Canada, enjoy many of the privileges of Canadian citizenship, apply for Canadian citizenship after three years and sponsor family members for Canadian Permanent Resident status.

As a general rule, you must submit your Canada Immigration Visa Application (Application for Permanent Residence in Canada) to the Canadian Immigration Visa Office responsible for the country of your citizenship or to the visa office responsible for the country you are currently residing in if you have been legally admitted to that country for at least one year. Applicants to the federal economic immigration programs must first create an online profile in the Express Entry immigration selection system.

        Yes, there is. Immigrating to Canada has become more and more complicated over time. There are currently more than 60 different federal and provincial immigration programs under which an applicant may qualify and it is very difficult for an individual to know which program is most suitable for his or her circumstances. Even though Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) permits you to submit a Canadian Immigration Visa Application on your own, statistically, your chances of succeeding are increased if a qualified Canadian immigration attorney represents you. Moreover, a perfected application will, in many cases, avoid unnecessary delays, allowing you to obtain your Canada Immigration Visa faster.

        All applications for Canadian Permanent Resident Visas are submitted to designated intake offices in Canada and the government processing fees associated with these applications must be paid in Canadian dollars. The Right of Permanent Residence Fee (RPRF) may, depending on the circumstances, be paid inside or outside Canada. If payable outside Canada, you should check with the Canadian visa office that is processing the application to determine the currency in which the RPRF must be paid. Applications for a Temporary Resident (Visitor) Visa, Work Permit, or Study Permit are generally submitted to Canadian visa offices outside Canada and you should check with the Canadian visa office closest to you.

        Many factors affect immigration application processing times, including the following:

the particular Canadian Immigration Visa Office processing your application;
the category of Canadian Immigration under which you apply;
whether you can find work in Canada;
the way in which your application and supporting documents have been prepared;
whether or not you are required to attend a personal interview; and,
events beyond your control.

It is difficult to find a reliable source to provide you with an accurate indication of just how long it will take for you to receive your Canada Immigration Visa. Published times are not always up to date. Information you may find on newsgroups and forums is even less trustworthy as there is no accountability for the messages posted on them. Be suspect of anyone who tells you that there is a way to get your Canada Immigration Visa quicker for a fee; it is not true.

		Frequently asked questions about refugee status in Canada.

        -
        1. Do I qualify for Canadian Refugee Status?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        A refugee is a person who fears persecution if they go back to their country of nationality. Fear of persecution usually means a serious chance of physical harm or detention or some other form of cruel and unusual punishment. In some cases discrimination or harassment could be considered serious enough to amount to persecution.
    









    
        +
        -
        2. Must I have already experienced persecution?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        No. The Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship standard is whether or not there is a serious possibility that you would be persecuted if you go back to your country.

        -
        3. What are typical examples of refugee cases that are accepted?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Some typical examples of refugee cases include:

Members of minority religious groups or ethnic minorities who fear persecution from the general population or non-governmental organizations where the police are unable or unwilling to protect them.
Members of an opposition political party who fear retribution because of their political opinion or their refusal to support the government.
People who are persecuted by a powerful criminal gang or mafia such as drug traffickers.
Homosexuals who are persecuted simply because of their sexual orientation.
Women who fear beatings from their husbands, violence or other serious forms of punishment from other family members.
Women who refuse to conform to expectations such as arranged marriages, dress code and genital mutilation. In fact Canada is a world leader in recognizing gender-based persecution and has issued guidelines to ensure that these claims are dealt with in a fair and sensitive manner.

In all the above cases refugees must explain what persecution they fear and why they cannot receive protection from their government.

        4. Can my family members be protected with me?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes, in most cases Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly CIC) respects the principle of family unity. Therefore, a family will typically have one hearing and one decision.

        -
        5. How do I know if my refugee claim will be accepted?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        There is no guaranteed way to know if you will be accepted since a single decision maker of Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board will hear your testimony and must decide if your claim is credible. That is why it is essential to provide documentary proof of your story and to be well prepared for your hearing, and to hire a lawyer who is an expert in refugee law. Since June 28, 2002, the government of Canada accepts refugees who fear cruel and unusual punishment, a risk to their life, or torture. However, your claim will not be accepted if your fear is one of generalized violence faced by everyone in the country, if it is based on a need for medical treatment, or if you can obtain protection from the authorities in any part of your country. Furthermore, if the Refugee Board believes that you are a member of a terrorist group, have participated in human rights violations or have committed serious non-political crimes, you can be excluded from refugee protection. If you are a citizen in more than one country, you must explain why you cannot obtain protection in all your countries of citizenship. If you can automatically obtain protection in another country then you could be denied protection in Canada.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The federal government of Canada guarantees emergency medical treatment at no charge for those who cannot afford to buy their own medical insurance. Some medical clinics also offer free check ups to refugee claimants.

        11. Is it true that Canada has closed its borders to refugees coming from the U.S.A.?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        As of December 2004, refugees entering Canada by land from the United States are no longer allowed to make their refugee claims at the Canadian Port of Entry. However, this does not apply to refugees who make their refugee claim from inside of Canada, regardless of how they arrived. It does not apply to people arriving at Canadian airports even if they first passed through the U.S. Even in claims made at the U.S. - Canada border, exceptions apply for children under 18, and for refugees who have extended family members in Canada including parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, uncles and aunts.

        12. Can I apply for refugee protection from outside Canada?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes, if you are outside your country, but this is very difficult in most cases. You must first apply to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). You usually have to show that you will be economically successful in Canada. Also, the refugee definition is more restrictive, you do not have the right to a lawyer at your interview, and the waiting period could be many years. You must also show that you cannot be settled in your country of present residence.

        1. Can I just “move” to Canada?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Well, yes and no. American citizens do not require a visa to visit Canada for personal or business reasons. As a visitor, unless otherwise indicated by a Canadian immigration officer at a Canadian Port of Entry, you may remain in Canada for up to six months. However, to gain entry the immigration officer must be satisfied that you are a bona fide visitor, which means that you intend to leave Canada at the end of your visit. As a visitor you may not centralize your mode of living in Canada, and as a general rule you may not work in Canada without first securing a work permit. You may study in Canada without a study permit only if the course of study is six months or less in duration.

        2. What are the different ways to go to Canada?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        There are many ways to immigrate to Canada or to reside in Canada temporarily. Every year, thousands of U.S. citizens and residents move to Canada as workers, students, or permanent residents.

Canadian permanent residence

Permanent resident status allows an individual to live in, work in and enjoy Canada on a permanent basis, with no time limitation to the status and no restriction on movement within the labour market. Broadly speaking, there are three categories of immigration programs that lead to permanent residence: economic programs (for skilled workers and business persons), family reunification programs (for spouses, common-law partners, parents, grandparents and dependent children of Canadian citizens and permanent residents), and refugee/humanitarian programs. U.S. citizens are unlikely to be successful through the latter category (see question 19).


To learn more about your Canadian immigration options through the economic programs, fill out a free assessment form.
For individuals who have a close family member who is a citizen or permanent resident of Canada, as well as individuals who have a Canadian spouse or common-law partner, please complete this free Family Class assessment form to learn more about your options.



Temporary residence in Canada

Many U.S. citizens and residents choose to come to Canada on a temporary basis, and many go on to pursue permanent residence. U.S.-based workers enjoy certain benefits due to the close trade relationship between the U.S. and Canada (see question 10), while students may pursue further education in Canada — quality institutions and cheaper tuition costs are just two of the incentives. In addition, U.S. citizens can come to visit Canada, typically being granted the right to travel around the country for up to six months per entry.

        In general, U.S. citizens moving to Canada may bring accompanying family members. However, the specifics depend on the status you may be seeking in Canada.

Short-term visitors (i.e. less than six months)
International students
Work permit holders
Permanent residents

It is best to review which type of entry to Canada you wish to undertake, then look into the options for bringing family members.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship such as a passport, birth certificate, a certificate of citizenship or naturalization, or a Certificate of Indian Status along with photo identification. U.S. permanent residents (i.e. Green Card holders) should ensure they carry proof of status, such as their U.S. Permanent Resident Card (Green Card).
Whether you're entering by air, land or water, it is recommended that you carry a valid passport for all travel abroad, including visits to Canada from the U.S. A passport may be required by your airline or alternative transportation authority, as it is the only universally-accepted identification document.
Citizens of the U.S. who are members of the NEXUS program may present their membership card to the CBSA as proof of identification and as a document that denotes citizenship, when arriving by air, land, or marine modes.
Permanent residents of the U.S. who are members of the NEXUS or FAST programs must travel with a passport and proof of permanent residence, and may be asked to present these documents to the officer upon arrival at the border.

        Many U.S. citizens and residents may not be aware that a prior offence, even one as seemingly minor as a driving violation, may render a person inadmissible to Canada. If you are in any doubt, you will need to know what steps to take before and during your Canadian immigration or temporary resident visa application process in order to be permitted to enter Canada. Some examples of convictions that could make you inadmissible to Canada include: DUI, DWAI, theft, petty theft/larceny, assault, drunk & disorderly conduct, obstruction of justice, and possession of marijuana, cocaine or other controlled substances/drugs. This list is by no means exhaustive.
If you have been found to be criminally inadmissible to Canada, or think you may be inadmissible, it is important to know that you still have options. Contact a legal advisor to learn more about your options.

        7. Can my state of health affect my ability to immigrate to Canada?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes, if you have a health issue it is possible that you are medically inadmissible to Canada.  Medical inadmissibility comes about in one of two contexts:

The less common of these is medical inadmissibility that results from being assessed as a threat to the health of Canadians. This would be case for those afflicted with a communicable disease that poses a risk of proliferation within Canada. This is relatively rare as there are not many contagious illnesses or conditions that permanently affect one’s state of health. HIV and AIDS are examples of such a situation, and can be grounds for a determination of medical inadmissibility.
More often than not, medical inadmissibility is determined by assessing how large a strain a particular individual would put on the Canadian healthcare system. If one’s state of health requires significant and frequent medical intervention, that individual can be found medically inadmissible. There are no strict criteria or guidelines as to what constitutes medical inadmissibility in this context as this determination is made on a case by case basis. However, the cost of any medication required and the frequency with which one must see a medical specialist are among the factors that that are considered.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Many foreign workers in Canada are working as an intra-company transferee. This means that the worker has been transferred by his or her employer to work in a parent, a subsidiary, a branch, or an affiliate of that enterprise in Canada. There are provisions under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that allow intra-company transferees from the U.S. to work in Canada.
Transferees must have at least one year of full-time work experience with the foreign enterprise and be coming to Canada to perform comparable work for the Canadian affiliate. Work in Canada must fall under one of three categories:

Executive

An employee who primarily directs the management of the enterprise or a major component thereof.



Senior Managerial

An employee who manages all or part of the enterprise and supervises/controls the work of other managers or professional employees.



Specialized Knowledge

An employee who can demonstrate specialized knowledge of the enterprise's product or service or an advanced level of expertise in the enterprise's processes and procedures.


In order for the foreign worker to receive a work permit, the Canadian business will have to demonstrate a qualifying relationship with its foreign counterpart, as well as a qualifying relationship with its employee.

At a time when young Americans are faced with escalating tuition costs, mounting student debt, and higher barriers to entry than before, many are noticing that a world-class higher education is available on the same continent, and often for a fraction of the cost. International students in Canada can also work while studying, allowing them to supplement their income and gain vital work experience.
Furthermore, studying in Canada also a pathway towards developing a professional career and immigrating to Canada permanently.

         15. I have heard that Canada has a points-based immigration system. What does this mean? Where can I get information on this?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Canada’s world-renowned points-based immigration system is often referenced by U.S.-based media and politicians as a model that could (or should) be emulated abroad. In reality, it is not just one points-based system, but a number of points-based immigration programs that aim to attract, rank, and/or invite certain individuals and their families to immigrate to Canada.
The Federal Skilled Worker Class is the federal government’s flagship immigration program. The concept is relatively simple; there are up to 100 points available for a number of factors including age, level of education, language ability, work experience, whether or not the individual has arranged employment in Canada, and certain adaptability factors. If the individual can claim 67 or more points, he or she is eligible to enter the Express Entry pool.
Here, the individual (now a candidate, having created an online Express Entry profile) is ranked along with other candidates, including candidates who entered the pool via other programs that allow people with Canadian work experience and skilled tradespersons to immigrate to Canada. The Express Entry pool is a competitive environment, with a points-based ranking system where candidates are awarded up to 1,200 points under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) for a variety of factors. The government conducts periodic draws, in which the top-ranked candidates are issued an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence.
Confused? Let’s use a hypothetical example. A U.S. citizen wants to immigrate to Canada and, having filled out a free assessment form, finds that she can claim 74 points under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. She creates an Express Entry profile, where she is awarded 500 CRS points. She then receives an ITA is a subsequent draw from the pool. This ITA provides a 90-day during which she may submit a complete immigration application, and from that point the government aims to process the application within six months.
In addition to this federal system, there are also a range of points-based immigration categories under the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). The criteria for these categories are set by provincial and territorial governments, who may issue a nomination certificate to successful applicants and their family members, if applicable. Under the PNPs, the federal government only oversees admissibility factors, including medical and security background checks.

        Canada Green Card a term that is used figuratively to describe permanent residence in Canada.
In the U.S. a United States Permanent Resident Card is popularly known as a Green Card. Instead of a Canada Green Card, permanent residents of Canada have the right to a Canada Permanent Resident Card as proof of their Canada immigration status. A U.S. Green Card grants the holder the permission to enter and live in the United States. In contrast, Canada Permanent Resident status grants an individual the right to enter and live in Canada.

        17. Do I need to take a language test to immigrate to Canada?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Individuals wishing to immigrate to Canada through an economic immigration program (i.e. not being sponsored by a spouse/common-law partner and not with refugee status) are required to prove language ability in English and/or French. This proof comes in the form of language test results.
For the federal economic immigration programs, all candidates must include International English Language Testing System (IELTS), OR Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program (CELPIP), OR Test d'Evaluation de Francais (TEF) results. No other method is approved to support language abilities for these programs. The CELPIP exam is only available within Canada, and the TEF is only for individuals wishing to be tested in French ability. Effectively, this leaves the IELTS General Version as the only real option for English-speaking individuals outside Canada.
Language test results are also required for the economic categories of the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). There is a separate program for individuals with work or study experience in the province of Quebec that allows eligible individuals to submit an application without necessarily submitting language test results, but this program (known as the Quebec Experience Class) only assesses French ability, not English ability.

        19. Do I need a job offer?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        A job offer is not required in order to immigrate to Canada permanently. However, a job offer from a Canadian employer is a valuable factor. Take the following cases in point:

Potential applicants under the Federal Skilled Worker Class (FSWC, Canada’s flagship immigration program for skilled international workers) may obtain up to 10 points towards eligibility for a job offer. The pass mark for eligibility is 67 points.
A job offer is required for potential applicants under the Federal Skilled Trades Class (FSTC).
A job offer is also worth 50 or 200 (for senior executive positions) points once a FSWC or FSTC candidate is in the Express Entry pool. The total number of available points is 1,200, and these points for a job offer could make all the difference in being invited to apply for Canadian permanent residence.
A job offer is often, though not always, required under the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs).

As for working in Canada temporarily, in most cases a job offer would be required. Under the auspices of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), U.S. citizens may be eligible for facilitated processing when applying for a temporary work permit in Canada. Work permits under the provisions of NAFTA do not require a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), a process that ensures Canadian citizens and permanent residents are able to apply for an open position before the job may be offered to a foreign worker.
Workers in the U.S. who work for a company that has a Canadian office or affiliate may work in Canada as an intra-company transferee. See question 10 to learn more about intra-company transfers.
U.S. citizens under 30 years of age who have been enrolled in full-time post-secondary study at some point in the past twelve months may be able to work in Canada on a SWAP working holiday visa.

        20. What is the Express Entry immigration system?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Express Entry is an electronic management application system for immigration to Canada.
It is not a new immigration program. Rather, it facilitates the selection and processing of Canada’s economic immigration programs:

the Federal Skilled Worker Class,
the Federal Skilled Trades Class,
the Canadian Experience Class, and
a portion of the Provincial Nominee Programs. 

Applicants make an "expression of interest" (EOI) in immigrating to Canada and, if they are eligible for at least one of the aforementioned programs, they then enter the Express Entry pool, where they are ranking according to the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). The federal government then selects candidates from this pool, who receive an Invitation To Apply (ITA) for immigration to Canada under one of the programs. Express Entry moves Canada from a first come, first served (or supply-driven) system to an invitation to apply (or demand-driven) system. Modeled on similar systems in use in Australia and New Zealand, Express Entry aims to fast track the processing of skilled immigrants deemed most likely to succeed in Canada.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) allow Canadian provinces and territories to nominate individuals who wish to immigrate to Canada and who are interested in settling in a particular province.
Provincial and territorial governments have been using these programs to more effectively and efficiently welcome newcomers to their region. Each PNP is tailored to the province or territory's specific needs to select nominees who will be able to settle into life and work in the region and to effectively contribute to the community. Most PNPs contain at least one stream/category aligned with the federal Express Entry immigration selection system. These are known as 'enhanced' nominations. The remaining streams/categories exist outside the Express Entry system, and are known as ‘base’ nominations.
Some PNP categories allow individuals in certain in-demand occupations to submit an application without a job offer. One such example is the Saskatchewan International Skilled Worker category, which includes base and enhanced sub-categories.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The government of Canada recognizes that family reunification is an important aspect of its immigration policy.  A Canadian citizen or permanent resident may sponsor a spouse or common-law partner for Canadian permanent residence.
Both the Canadian citizen or permanent resident (also called the 'sponsor') and the foreign national (the 'sponsored person') must be approved by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) in order for the sponsored person to receive a visa.
In order to receive a visa through this immigration program, the sponsor and sponsored person must prove that their relationship qualifies under one of three categories:

Spouse
Common-law partner
Conjugal partner

Canada recognizes same-sex marriage, and same-sex partners may be eligible to apply under any of the above three categories, provided they meet all eligibility requirements.

        Yes. International investors may seek permanent residence by making a passive investment through the Quebec Investor Program. The program allows investors to obtain Canadian permanent residence by investing CAD$800,000 risk-free through an approved financial intermediary or by financing that investment. 
There is also an investment opportunity under NAFTA. A NAFTA Investor must demonstrate that he or she has made a substantial investment in a new or existing Canadian business and that he or she is seeking entry to Canada to develop and direct the Canadian business. Work permits in the NAFTA Investor category may also be granted to employees of the primary investor who can be considered essential staff.

        27. What documents might I need in order to make an application for permanent residence?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The range of documentation required in order to submit an application for permanent residence can be extensive. In each case, the required documentation will depend on two factors: the program you are applying to, and your personal circumstances.
That being said, the following documents are typically required in every case:

Valid passport
Language test results
Documentation attesting to work experience
Police clearance certificate(s)
Photographs of principal applicant and family members

Depending on circumstances, the following may be asked for:

Upfront medical receipt
Birth certificate
Canadian Education Credential OR Educational Credential Assessment (ECA)
Letter of attestation
Official transcripts of post-secondary education study program courses taken
Secondary education documents
Original letter from a Canadian employer indicating an offer of arranged employment
Proof of family relationship(s) in Canada
Proof of settlement funds
Legal documents showing changes in name or date of birth
Marriage certificate(s)
Signed Statutory Declaration of Common-law Union and documents attesting to cohabitation for a period of at least 12 months
Divorce or annulment certificate(s)
Death certificate(s) for former spouse(s) or common-law partner(s)
Children’s birth certificates
Adoption papers
Proof of full custody for children
Travel documents (non-passport)
Certified copy of a certificate of qualification in a skilled trade occupation issued by a Canadian provincial/territorial authority
Copies of work contracts and/or pay stubs
Documents relating to income taxation

        28. Will the fact that I have an independent source of income or pension help me immigrate as I will not be a financial burden to Canada?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        In order to become a Canadian permanent resident, it must be shown that an applicant has sufficient resources to support themselves and their family, if applicable. This is accomplished by providing proof to the government of Canada that the applicant has a certain amount of money at his or her disposal. These settlement funds and the amount that must be demonstrated varies depending on the number of family members included in the principal applicant’s application. Settlement funds cannot be borrowed, and the principal applicant must be able to use this money to pay the costs of living for his or her family, even if not these family members are not accompanying the applicant to Canada. To determine the required amount of settlement funds you may refer to the following table. 
If you have a source of income that assures you have at least the applicable amount of settlement funds at your disposable, this means that in terms of finances you are eligible to apply for permanent residence. However, beyond this, an independent source of income will not further increase your chances of becoming a Canadian permanent resident. Canada is typically looking for applicants that can contribute economically to the country, not for those who are merely financially self-sufficient.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        A determination as to whether an individual or family may be given asylum or refugee status is not determined by nationality. Nationality is not the central issue. What matters is how people are being treated and protected by the state that they are in. That being said, only a minuscule share of American refugee claimants are approved in Canada, and it is unlikely that an application for asylum or refugee status in Canada made by a U.S. citizen would be approved.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Canada and the U.S. have a Tax Treaty that, for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital, should make relocating to Canada as smooth a process as possible. While one of the primary differences between the two countries is that Canadian income tax laws are based on residency (while U.S. tax laws are based on citizenship), the Tax Treaty between Canada and U.S.A. has several mechanisms available known as foreign tax credits, to make sure the person does not have to pay duplicate taxes to both countries.

        Yes. Not only that, but U.S. citizens who immigrate to Canada and spend a few years residing in Canada may also eventually choose to become citizens of their adopted homeland. This is a process known as naturalization, and Canada has one of the most liberal and welcoming naturalization processes in the world. According to both U.S. law, individuals can be a citizen of the U.S. and of another country. The same provision exists for Canadians who acquire a second citizenship.

        Canada has a public health care system that makes critical care accessible to all Canadian citizens and permanent residents alike, as well as certain temporary residents. When it comes to the administration of health care, the U.S. and Canada are quite different. Though the health care system in Canada is actually a number of sub-systems run by the provincial ministries of health, the federal government sets the standards for health care across the country.

        33. What is Canada’s political system like? Is it markedly different from the system in the U.S.?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Canada is what is known as a "Democratic Federation", with both federal and provincial levels of government. Although the U.S. is also a democracy, there are some important differences between the two democracies in Canada and the U.S. Let’s run through some of them:

Canada does not have a President. The head of government is the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister is not directly elected by the electorate. He or she is voted into that office by members of the House of Commons, which meets on Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa.
Members of Parliament are elected using a first-past-the post system, whereby the candidate who wins a plurality of votes in a riding (like a congressional district) is elected to serve that riding in Parliament.
Currently, five political parties are represented in the House of Commons. The governing Liberal Party holds a majority of seats. The Conservative Party, with the next highest number of seats, forms the official opposition. The New Democratic Party (NDP) has a sizeable number of seats and is generally perceived to be a social democratic party of the left. The Bloc Québécois, which has a handful of seats, is devoted to the interests of the province of Quebec, and the Green Party has a single elected Member of Parliament (MP).
There is currently no avowedly anti-immigration party with elected representation at the federal level. Each party recognizes the contributions that newcomers to Canada make to the economy and Canadian society.
Canada does not have states. Instead, it has 10 provinces and three territories. Each province and territory has its own democratically-elected government that holds jurisdiction over certain areas of governance. Other areas of governance are held by the federal government, while certain powers are shared between the federal and provincial/territorial governments.
Only Canadian citizens may vote at the federal and provincial levels.

Overall, the tone and rhetoric of how politics is ‘done’ in Canada is quite different to its U.S. counterpart, particularly if we are just comparing recent years.

        1. What are the Provincial Nominee Programs?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         The Provincial Nominee Programs were established by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly CIC) to allow Canada's different provinces and territories to select individuals who indicate an interest in settling in a particular province/territory and who will be able to contribute to that province/territory's economic development.
Most, but not all, provinces and territories of Canada participate in the Provincial Nominee Program.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         No. Quebec has a separate agreement with the Government of Canada, which allows the province to select individuals who indicate a desire to reside in that province. The government of Quebec is the only provincial government with the authority to determine the selection of individuals outside of the Provincial Nominee Program. Quebec has its own immigration selection criteria.

        7. How do the Provincial Nominee Programs work with the Express Entry immigration selection system?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Provinces and territories are able to nominate a certain number of candidates through the Express Entry system to meet local and provincial labour market needs. These portions of the PNPs are known as “enhanced” nominations.
Candidates in the Express Entry pool who obtain an enhanced nomination from a province are awarded 600 points under the Comprehensive Ranking System, out of a possible total of 1,200. When these additional points are added to a candidate’s human capital and skills transferability points, it will result in an invitation to apply for permanent residence at a subsequent draw from the Express Entry pool.
All candidates must meet the eligibility criteria of one of the following federal economic immigration programs in order to enter and be selected from the Express Entry pool:

Federal Skilled Worker (FSW)
Federal Skilled Trades (FST)
Canadian Experience Class (CEC)

Provinces and territories may add additional criteria for their own immigration streams.
Depending on the province, candidates eligible to enter the Express Entry pool may either enter the pool first and then be nominated by a province or territory, or be nominated by a province or territory before completing an online Express Entry profile and entering the Express Entry pool. 
Note: As of November 19, 2016, changes will be made to the Comprehensive Ranking System. To learn more, click here.

        8. What is a "base" Provincial Nomination?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Provinces and territories are also able to make nominations under their regular, or “base”, PNPs outside the Express Entry system. Individuals who wish to immigrate to Canada, but who are not eligible to enter the Express Entry pool, may still be able to make an application to immigrate to Canada through a base PNP, as long as they are eligible for the provincial program. Base nominations may therefore provide Canadian immigration opportunities to individuals who are not eligible for Express Entry.
Candidates who receive a base nomination have their applications processed outside Express Entry. The route from a successful base nomination to permanent residence is a two-step process. Candidates must first satisfy the criteria for a PNP stream, apply, and receive a nomination certificate. With this certificate in hand, candidates may apply to the federal government for permanent resident status.

Close relations in that province

        This stream is a process in which employers from Alberta can nominate the workers they need from outside Canada if they have been unable to fill vacant permanent positions with Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents. If an employer has extended a permanent job offer to a candidate, and the candidate has accepted the job offer, they can apply for a Provincial Nomination Certificate.
The stream consists of three main immigration categories:

The first is the Skilled Worker Category, in which the position to be filled is a skilled occupation that falls under the “0,” “A,” or “B” skill levels in the National Occupation Classification (NOC).
The second is the International Graduate Category, in which an employer is filling a position (in the “A,” “0,” or “B” skill levels) with a foreign student who has completed post-secondary education at a publicly funded institution in Canada.
The third category is the Semi-Skilled Worker Category, in which the position to be filled is a specific industry but does not fall under the “0,” “A,” or “B” skill levels, but rather under the “C” or “D” skill levels.

        As part of any PNP application, applicants are required to submit a Settlement Plan indicating why they wish to live in the province and how they intend to settle. Applicants are also required to sign an ‘intention to reside’ document with their application. That being said, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ensures that all Canadian citizens and permanent residents are allowed to work and reside in any location across Canada. Once an individual obtains Canadian permanent residence, he or she has the right to work and reside in any Canadian province or territory.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP), formerly known as the Opportunities Ontario Provincial Nominee Program (OOPNP), is a program under which prospective immigrants with the skills and experience targeted by the province may receive an Ontario Provincial Nomination Certificate, which will allow that foreign national to apply for Canadian permanent residence with processing times that are faster than other Canadian immigration classes.

        2. How does the OINP work?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The OINP is an immigration program through which Ontario nominates individuals and their families for permanent resident status based on provincial labour market objectives. The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program offers both base and enhanced (Express Entry) nominations.
Eligible candidates for an OINP stream can, depending on the stream in question, either make an application directly to the program or receive a Notification of Interest (NOI), which serves as an invitation to apply from the province to the potential applicant. The province will determine eligibility and process the application. If the applicant is successful, he or she receives a provincial nomination certificate. From this point, the applicant makes an application for permanent residence to the federal government, which determines medical and security admissibility.
The OINP accepts applications under the following immigration categories:

Ontario Express Entry
General Category (sometimes referred to as Employer Category)
International Student Category
Business Category

        Ontario has two immigration streams aligned with the federal Express Entry immigration selection system, also referred to as enhanced Express Entry streams. These streams are called Ontario Express Entry: Human Capital Priorities Stream (see question 13 for more details) and Ontario Express Entry: French-Speaking Skilled Worker Stream (see question 15 for more details). By receiving an enhanced provincial nomination from one of these streams, candidates receive an extra 600 Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points, resulting in an Invitation To Apply (ITA) for permanent residence being issued at a subsequent draw from the Express Entry pool.

        The General Category, sometimes referred to as the Employer Category or the Foreign Skilled Workers with a Job Offer Stream, allows Ontario employers to recruit foreign workers for approved skilled positions (NOC Skill Type 0 or Skill Level A or B). These employees may be living abroad or in Canada at the time of application.
Under this category, both the employer and the foreign national must submit an application to show that eligibility requirements are met. Employers must first submit a Pre-screen Application to the OINP in order to have the position they want to fill approved. If this application is approved, the foreign worker the employer is seeking to recruit must then submit a Nominee Application to the OINP.

Frequently asked questions about work in Canada.







    
        +
        -
        1. Is a job offer required for immigration to Canada under the Skilled Worker/Professional category?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        No. Applicants can still qualify for a Canada Immigration (Permanent Resident) Visa without a Canadian job offer. However, Canadian employers play a greater role in Canadian immigration under the federal Express Entry immigration selection system than they did previously, meaning that, for many candidates, obtaining a valid Canadian job offer significantly increases their chances of being invited to apply for Canadian permanent residence. Candidates in the Express Entry pool have the opportunity to increase their chances of being invited to apply by promoting themselves directly to employers through the CanadaVisa Job Search tool. 
Candidates should note that the Quebec Skilled Worker category of immigration and some of the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) do not require a Canadian job offer in order to qualify either.

        3. Are there different types of job offers that a Canadian employer can make?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes. There are essentially two types of job offers that a Canadian employer can make:

A temporary job offer is an offer of Canadian employment that is made for a specific period of time – six months, one year, etc… Individuals can only begin working, in most cases, after they receive a Temporary Work Permit.


A permanent job offer is an offer of Canadian employment that is made for an indeterminate period of time. Individuals can only begin working after they receive a Canada Immigration Visa.

        4. Is it possible to apply for a Temporary Work Permit and a Canada Immigration Visa?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes. Individuals may apply for a Temporary Work Permit on its own or in combination with an application for a Canada Immigration Visa. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly CIC) recognizes the concept of "dual intent" whereby an applicant desires to work in Canada temporarily and thereafter reside and work in Canada permanently.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Under Express Entry, candidates who are successful in obtaining a job offer supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) are awarded an additional 50 or 200 points under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), depending on the position offered. Although this CRS points bonus does not guarantee that the candidate will be invited to apply for permanent residence in Canada, the fact that he or she has obtained a qualifying job offer means that he or she is more likely to be issued an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence at a subsequent draw from the pool, therefore fast-tracking the immigration process.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        There are significant benefits to obtaining a temporary Canadian job offer:

A job offer is the starting point for obtaining a Temporary Work Permit.
Coming to Canada on a Work Permit is the quickest way to enter Canada and work. The Work Permit application process can usually be completed in a matter of days or weeks.
The Canadian employer of a Work Permit holder in Canada can offer the individual a permanent full-time job of indeterminate length and the new job offer will be considered arranged employment in Canada under the Federal Skilled Worker Class.

        8. Is it difficult to find a good job in Canada?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        No. Once in Canada, there are many available rewarding employment opportunities. Each day in Canada more than 50,000 job postings go unfilled. Getting a job offer from outside Canada is more of a challenge but certainly can be accomplished with a little bit of perseverance, especially with the tools and guidance that our Canadian law firm offers. Many Canadian employers have a keen demand for skilled workers and professionals. There is no reason why an applicant from outside of Canada can't be a part of their solution.
The Canada Job Bank is an online search engine for open job positions across Canada that helps match candidates with Canadian employers and jobs based on their skills, knowledge, and experience. Under Express Entry, candidates may register with the Job Bank. As of June 6, 2017, registration in the Job Bank is no longer required for candidates who do not already have a Canadian job offer or a Provincial/Territorial nomination. However, it is recommended that they do so, in order to increase their visibility to Canadian employers.
Should the Express Entry candidate choose to apply to a job opportunity, the recipient employer will then be required to go through their usual interview or assessment process. If the employer finds that the Express Entry candidate meets their needs, and they are eligible to hire a foreign national, they can offer them a job. 
Furthermore, candidates in the Express Entry pool have the opportunity to increase their chances of being invited to apply by promoting themselves directly to employers through the CanadaVisa Job Search tool.

        Separate and apart from a work permit, an applicant will need a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) unless the applicant is from one of the following visa-exempt countries. In most cases, citizens of visa-exempt countries are required to obtain an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) in order to enter Canada. 
Applicants must apply for a TRV at the Canadian visa office responsible for their country of citizenship or the country to which they have been lawfully admitted. An application for an eTA is usually submitted online, although a paper application process is available.

        As a general rule, work permits apply to a specific employer. If an individual changes employers he or she must apply for a new work permit. Only workers admitted to Canada on an open work permit can change employer without reapplying. Open work permits are the exception and may be available to the spouses/common law partners of certain work permit holders, the spouses/common law partners of foreign students in Canada, asylum seekers, in-land sponsored family members, and destitute students in Canada.

        Often, employment and business opportunities are time sensitive and for that reason having a legal representative in Canada with expertise in the area of work permits is the most efficient way to proceed.
It is important to note that, while an applicant's qualifications are supposed to be the determining factor in the success of a work permit application, the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) Officer's discretion can play a crucial role in the final outcome of each case. Under Canadian immigration regulations, IRCC Officers are given a great deal of discretion in the handling of work permit applications.

Frequently asked questions about work in Canada.







    
        +
        -
        1. Is a job offer required for immigration to Canada under the Skilled Worker/Professional category?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        No. Applicants can still qualify for a Canada Immigration (Permanent Resident) Visa without a Canadian job offer. However, Canadian employers play a greater role in Canadian immigration under the federal Express Entry immigration selection system than they did previously, meaning that, for many candidates, obtaining a valid Canadian job offer significantly increases their chances of being invited to apply for Canadian permanent residence. Candidates in the Express Entry pool have the opportunity to increase their chances of being invited to apply by promoting themselves directly to employers through the CanadaVisa Job Search tool. 
Candidates should note that the Quebec Skilled Worker category of immigration and some of the Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) do not require a Canadian job offer in order to qualify either.

        2. What is a "job offer" within the context of Canadian immigration?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        A job offer is a genuine offer of employment from a legitimate Canadian employer.

        3. Are there different types of job offers that a Canadian employer can make?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes. There are essentially two types of job offers that a Canadian employer can make:

A temporary job offer is an offer of Canadian employment that is made for a specific period of time – six months, one year, etc… Individuals can only begin working, in most cases, after they receive a Temporary Work Permit.


A permanent job offer is an offer of Canadian employment that is made for an indeterminate period of time. Individuals can only begin working after they receive a Canada Immigration Visa.

        4. Is it possible to apply for a Temporary Work Permit and a Canada Immigration Visa?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes. Individuals may apply for a Temporary Work Permit on its own or in combination with an application for a Canada Immigration Visa. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC, formerly CIC) recognizes the concept of "dual intent" whereby an applicant desires to work in Canada temporarily and thereafter reside and work in Canada permanently.

        5. What are the advantages of obtaining a permanent job offer from a Canadian employer?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Under Express Entry, candidates who are successful in obtaining a job offer supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) are awarded an additional 50 or 200 points under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS), depending on the position offered. Although this CRS points bonus does not guarantee that the candidate will be invited to apply for permanent residence in Canada, the fact that he or she has obtained a qualifying job offer means that he or she is more likely to be issued an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence at a subsequent draw from the pool, therefore fast-tracking the immigration process.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        There are significant benefits to obtaining a temporary Canadian job offer:

A job offer is the starting point for obtaining a Temporary Work Permit.
Coming to Canada on a Work Permit is the quickest way to enter Canada and work. The Work Permit application process can usually be completed in a matter of days or weeks.
The Canadian employer of a Work Permit holder in Canada can offer the individual a permanent full-time job of indeterminate length and the new job offer will be considered arranged employment in Canada under the Federal Skilled Worker Class.

        8. Is it difficult to find a good job in Canada?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        No. Once in Canada, there are many available rewarding employment opportunities. Each day in Canada more than 50,000 job postings go unfilled. Getting a job offer from outside Canada is more of a challenge but certainly can be accomplished with a little bit of perseverance, especially with the tools and guidance that our Canadian law firm offers. Many Canadian employers have a keen demand for skilled workers and professionals. There is no reason why an applicant from outside of Canada can't be a part of their solution.
The Canada Job Bank is an online search engine for open job positions across Canada that helps match candidates with Canadian employers and jobs based on their skills, knowledge, and experience. Under Express Entry, candidates may register with the Job Bank. As of June 6, 2017, registration in the Job Bank is no longer required for candidates who do not already have a Canadian job offer or a Provincial/Territorial nomination. However, it is recommended that they do so, in order to increase their visibility to Canadian employers.
Should the Express Entry candidate choose to apply to a job opportunity, the recipient employer will then be required to go through their usual interview or assessment process. If the employer finds that the Express Entry candidate meets their needs, and they are eligible to hire a foreign national, they can offer them a job. 
Furthermore, candidates in the Express Entry pool have the opportunity to increase their chances of being invited to apply by promoting themselves directly to employers through the CanadaVisa Job Search tool.

        The same eligibility criteria apply to international graduates of Quebec institutions. The PGWP program recognizes programs unique to Quebec education system, as long as the program completed is at least 900 hours in length (which is the equivalent of 8 months). Eligible institutions include public or private secondary schools and private post-secondary schools, as long as they are recognized by the Ministère de l’Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport (the Department of Education, Recreation and Sports (MELS)). A PGWP obtained after completing a study program in Quebec is valid throughout Canada.

        A study or work is not a visa and doesn't allow you to travel back to Canada. If your TRV or eTA is still valid and your study permit has not expired you may be able to return to Canada. If your TRV or eTA expired, you will need to apply for a new one. If your application for a PGWP was approved during your time outside of Canada, you may enter the country as a worker. 
A border officer may ask for proof that you applied for a PGWP when you return to the country. For example, a copy of your application, the fee payment receipt, etc.

        28. What is implied status? How does that impact my PGWP application?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Implied status is when student or worker applies to extend their status before that status expires, so they can stay in Canada until a decision is made on a new permit application.
Therefore, students who have completed their program of study can remain in Canada under the same conditions of their study permit while they are waiting for a decision on their PGWP application as long as they were full-time students enrolled at a designated learning institution in a participating post-secondary institution, and they did not exceed the allowable hours of work.

        1. What is implied status?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        A person can legally remain in Canada under implied status if their previous permit for temporary stay has expired, but their application for a new permit is underway. Implied status permits the individual, and his or her family if applicable, to continue living in Canada under the conditions of the expired permit until a decision is made on the application. This generally applies to individuals or families who have applied for an extension of their work permit, study permit, or visitor visa. For more information, please click here.

        No. An individual or family who has applied for an extension of a previous permit automatically obtains implied status upon the expiration of the previous permit, while awaiting a decision on the application.

        If a temporary worker applies for a work permit extension for the same employer before the expiration of the previous permit, he or she may continue working under the conditions of the previous permit. That means that he or she may still work for the same employer. However, if he or she has applied for a work permit for a different employer, he or she must cease working when the permit expires and await the decision on the application.

        7. If someone on implied status leaves Canada, can they re-enter the country?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        People who leave Canada while on implied status may be able to re-enter Canada as temporary residents if they have a multiple-entry visa, or if they are temporary resident visa (TRV)-exempt. If someone from a country that requires a TRV leaves Canada to visit the United States or St Pierre and Miquelon only, he or she is considered TRV-exempt and can return to Canada as a temporary resident.
However, individuals on implied status in Canada cannot resume work or study after leaving and re-entering the country, until the new permit is issued for work or study. That is, if a student leaves Canada while on implied status and returns to the country before a decision has been made on the application, he or she will not be able to resume studying.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Proof of the application for an extension of a permit is generally accepted as proof of implied status. If the application was submitted while the individual's previous permit was valid, the individual remains on implied status. It is strongly recommended that an individual who leaves Canada while on implied status carries proof of the submission of the application, to assist with re-entry.

        If a candidate submits an application for a new work permit for a different employer, he or she must stop working when the previous permit expires. He or she must not work while awaiting a decision on the application for the new work permit. Similarly, if a student submits an application for a new study permit for a different institution, he or she must stop studying when the study permit expires and await the new study permit before resuming the studies assigned on the new permit.

        Applicants who have been in Canada on implied status may have permits that show a gap in the dates between the expiry of the former permit and the issue of the more recent one. However, the renewed permit will generally state that the holder maintained their status until the new permit was issued, thus explaining the gap in dates.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The first step is to get admission to a Canadian Designated Learning Institution (DLI) recognized by the government of Canada. Once an individual receives a letter of acceptance from a DLI, he or she may be able to apply for a study permit. Applications may be made online or by mail.
All new study permits are issued at a Canadian port of entry. An applicant who has submitted an application to a foreign Canadian Visa Office will be issued a letter of approval advising him or her to travel to a Canadian port of entry to have the study permit issued. A study permit is generally issued for the duration of the person’s studies.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         While a study permit authorizes international students to pursue their studies while in Canada, a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) allows a person to enter Canada. Depending on the country of citizenship, an international student may need a TRV for entry.
For overseas applications, applicants from countries whose citizens require TRV in order to enter Canada will be issued a TRV automatically if the application for a study permit is approved. These applicants do not need to submit a separate application for a TRV and there is no separate fee. The same applies to applicants from countries whose citizens need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) in order to enter Canada by air.

         An applicant is not required to obtain a study permit for a program, which is less than six months in duration. However, if a course is longer than six months, the prospective student will need to apply for a study permit.
There are benefits to applying to a study permit even if you are applying to a program that is less than six months. Even if you do not need a study permit, it may be beneficial to apply for one. In the event that you decide to continue studying in a new program after completing your short-term studies, without a study permit, you may be required to leave the country and apply through a Canadian visa office outside Canada. To apply for a permit for a short-term course or program, your studies must be at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI).

         An international student may be eligible to work while studying in Canada. A student must have a valid study permit and be enrolled full-time at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI). Study permit holders may be allowed to work for up to 20 hours per week during regular academic sessions and full time during scheduled breaks. To work “on-campus” a student must meet the following criteria listed on this page.
In order to work “off-campus”, a study permit must be authorized for off-campus work by a visa officer. If you are enrolled in a full-time academic, professional or vocational training program at a designated learning institution, you may be eligible to work “off-campus” without a work permit. However, it should be printed on the study permit that you are authorized to work off-campus.
An international student must stop working the day they no longer meet the eligibility requirements. There is an important exemption to this regulation: students enrolled in an English as a Second Language (ESL) or French as a Second Language (FSL) program are not authorized to work with a study permit.

If required, he or she will have to obtain a police certificate from each country or territory where he or she has lived for six or more months consecutively since the age of 18. Police certificates are required to determine if applicants have a criminal record. They also help visa officers make sure applicants are not a security risk to Canada.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         If a student is transferring from one Designated Learning Institution (DLI) to another, even if it is at the same level of study, he or she must notify Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (IRCC) by updating his or her online account and ensuring that the school is a DLI.
The same applies for post-secondary students changing their level of study (i.e. from a bachelor’s to master’s program). Please check the conditions listed on the study permit to verify whether the permit restricts the holder from studying at a particular institution or program.
If a student transfers to a school, college, or university in Quebec, he or she will need to apply for a Certificate of Acceptance to Quebec (CAQ) and, if necessary, a new study permit. Primary students who are entering high school, as well as high school students who will move on to post-secondary education, must apply to modify their study permit.

         A spouse or common-law partner of a valid study permit holder, who is enrolled full-time at a qualified post-secondary institution, may be eligible to apply for an open work permit.  The open work permit for a spouse or common-law partner may be valid for the same period of time as the study permit, and as long as the study permit remains valid. In the study permit application, the applicant should indicate that the spouse will accompany him or her to Canada. If a spouse later decides to study in Canada, he or she should submit his or her own study permit application.
For an accompanying spouse to be considered eligible for an open work permit, the study permit holder must be enrolled full-time at a degree-granting post-secondary institution. Eligible post-secondary institutions include:

public post-secondary institution, such as a college or university, or CEGEP in Quebec;
private college-level school in Quebec; and
Canadian private school that can legally award degrees under provincial law.

        22. Can a minor child study in Canada if he or she is under the age of majority? What is custodianship?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Each province and territory in Canada decides the age when a person is considered an adult, also known as the age of majority. The age of majority is usually 18 or 19 years of age depending on the province or territory. There are special requirements for a minor to be to study in Canada if he or she is under the age of majority. A minor child must either come with a parent or legal guardian or have a custodian in Canada. 
A custodian is a responsible adult who is also a Canadian citizen or permanent resident who is appointed to take care of and support the minor child in Canada. An immigration officer must be convinced that once the minor child travels to Canada to study he or she will have the proper care and support they need.
Unaccompanied minors wishing to obtain a study permit must appoint a custodian who will care for and support them while in Canada. To appoint a custodian, a Custodianship declaration form must be submitted with an application for a study permit. The declaration form needs to be signed by the custodian and the parents or legal guardians in the home country and certified by a lawyer or notary wherever signed.
For more information about finding a custodian, please contact the international student office of the institution where the minor child plans to study and consult this page.

        23. Is it possible to apply for study permit for a distance learning program?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Distance learning may be conducted through e-learning, correspondence, or online courses. Distance learning is a process that often involves a learning process by which technology is used to so that the student does not need to be physically present where the teaching is taking place. A study permit cannot be issued for a distance learning course.
However, if a distance learning program includes an in-Canada portion, and the length of the program is longer than six months then the student may receive a study permit for the in-Canada portion of the program. The duration of the study permit, however, is restricted to the duration of the in-Canada portion only.

        Implied status is when student or worker applies to extend their status before that status expires, so they can stay in Canada until a decision is made on a new permit application.
Therefore, students who have completed their program of study can remain in Canada under the same conditions of their study permit while they are waiting for a decision on their PGWP application as long as they were full-time students enrolled at a designated learning institution in a participating post-secondary institution, and they did not exceed the allowable hours of work.

        A person can legally remain in Canada under implied status if their previous permit for temporary stay has expired, but their application for a new permit is underway. Implied status permits the individual, and his or her family if applicable, to continue living in Canada under the conditions of the expired permit until a decision is made on the application. This generally applies to individuals or families who have applied for an extension of their work permit, study permit, or visitor visa. For more information, please click here.

That means that he or she may still work for the same employer. However, if he or she has applied for a work permit for a different employer, he or she must cease working when the permit expires and await the decision on the application.

        7. If someone on implied status leaves Canada, can they re-enter the country?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        People who leave Canada while on implied status may be able to re-enter Canada as temporary residents if they have a multiple-entry visa, or if they are temporary resident visa (TRV)-exempt. If someone from a country that requires a TRV leaves Canada to visit the United States or St Pierre and Miquelon only, he or she is considered TRV-exempt and can return to Canada as a temporary resident.
However, individuals on implied status in Canada cannot resume work or study after leaving and re-entering the country, until the new permit is issued for work or study. That is, if a student leaves Canada while on implied status and returns to the country before a decision has been made on the application, he or she will not be able to resume studying.

        Proof of the application for an extension of a permit is generally accepted as proof of implied status. If the application was submitted while the individual's previous permit was valid, the individual remains on implied status. It is strongly recommended that an individual who leaves Canada while on implied status carries proof of the submission of the application, to assist with re-entry.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        If a candidate submits an application for a new work permit for a different employer, he or she must stop working when the previous permit expires. He or she must not work while awaiting a decision on the application for the new work permit. Similarly, if a student submits an application for a new study permit for a different institution, he or she must stop studying when the study permit expires and await the new study permit before resuming the studies assigned on the new permit.

        10. Will the apparent gap in the dates between two permits affect a future application for a Canadian Permanent Residence visa?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Applicants who have been in Canada on implied status may have permits that show a gap in the dates between the expiry of the former permit and the issue of the more recent one. However, the renewed permit will generally state that the holder maintained their status until the new permit was issued, thus explaining the gap in dates.

The university has separate “colleges” — these are not distinct institutions, but a reflection of the college system used in the UK to provide a community for students.

Signature programs: Architecture, Commerce, Medicine, Engineering, Education, Public Health


McMaster University may be one of the older universities in Canada, but it has led the way in innovative education methods and is well-known for its self-directed, problem-based approach to learning. Located in Hamilton and surrounded by the Royal Botanical Gardens, “Mac” is at once a high-performing academic institution and a respite from the hustle and bustle of nearby Toronto.

Signature programs: Health Sciences, Medicine, Engineering, Social Sciences, MBA


University of Waterloo is located in the technology centre of Ontario, and its science programs are correspondingly popular. With so many tech companies nearby, employment prospects are good — and greatly aided by the largest co-op program in the world; more than 18,000 students are employed in co-op positions.

Signature programs: Statistics and Actuarial Science, Engineering, Architecture, Nanotechnology


University of Ottawa boasts Canada’s largest law faculty — this is no surprise, given its location in the country’s capital city. But that’s not all: Ottawa is one of Canada's top 10 research schools, with one of the best medical programs. It is also the second-largest bilingual university in Canada.

Toronto is the biggest city in Ontario, and in Canada. The finance and IT sectors are particularly strong areas of employment. Neighbouring towns and cities such as Mississauga, Whitby, and Brampton have gradually been absorbed by Toronto’s growth to form the “Greater Toronto Area”, or GTA.
Ottawa is the capital city of Ontario. In addition to excellent schools and tourism, many people are attracted by jobs with the federal government, which is the biggest employer in the region.
In past days, Hamilton was a major city for industry — particularly steel manufacture. After an economic downturn which resulted in many job losses, the city is now experiencing new growth in the service sector and the arts.
Waterloo is a hub for technology and innovation, and its local colleges and universities offer technology programs to reflect this. The corporate head office of Blackberry is located in Waterloo, and the company is the city’s largest employer.

Quebec’s college system is unique within Canada. After 11 years of elementary and secondary school, students may enter public colleges known as CEGEPs, where they may pursue vocational diplomas (DEP) or pre-university (DEC) courses. The former prepares students to enter the workforce directly or enter university; the latter prepares students to enter a Bachelor program with advanced standing (Bachelor programs in Canada for students who have completed CEGEP are usually three years in length). The following colleges are within the CEGEP system. Quebec also has a number of private colleges.
Founded in 1970, Vanier College was Montreal’s second English-language public college. Most of its approximately 6,000 students pursue pre-university programs, although as with other colleges in Quebec, three-year technical programs are also on offer. Vanier is located in the St. Laurent borough of Montreal, known for its diversity (according to the most recent census data, more than half of its residents reported a first language other than English or French) and residential feel. The college is also well-connected by metro to the downtown core.

Signature programs: Pre-University, Career Programs, Attestation Programs, College Majors, Sustainability

Quebec Experience Program: Many international students who come to study in Quebec eventually become permanent residents of Canada through the Quebec Experience Class, also known as the Programme de l’expérience Québécoise, or PEQ. This program operates a stream targeted at international students in Quebec. Indeed, this is one of the most straightforward pathways for international students to immigrate to Canada permanently, as it does not require individuals to reach a point threshold and/or receive an invitation to apply.


Quebec Skilled Worker Program: If a student is finishing his or her studies in Quebec and holds a valid CAQ and study permit, he or she may be eligible to apply through the Quebec Skilled Worker Program (QSWP) as a cap-exempt applicant. Candidates who have studied in Quebec must have completed at least one half of an eligible study program and be ready to enter the workforce. The QSWP uses a points-based system to assess applications of individuals who wish to settle in the province.


Express Entry: Candidates for immigration to Canada who have completed their education at a school in Quebec and ultimately wish to immigrate to another province or territory in Canada may do so through the federal Express Entry immigration selection system. Such individuals may be awarded a significant number of points on account of their high level of education. Moreover, international graduates of Canadian educational institutions may have obtained important Canadian work experience, another highly valued factor under the Express Entry system.


Studying in Quebec does not prevent an international graduate from submitting an application to a Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) elsewhere in Canada for which he or she may be eligible. However, applicants must have the intention to reside in the province to which he or she is applying through a given PNP category.

The province’s capital city is also officially named Quebec, but is often referred to as Quebec City. The city is one of the oldest settlements in North America, and local history is proudly preserved here. Université Laval is located in Quebec City.
Other major cities and towns in Quebec include Gatineau (across the river from Ottawa), Laval, Trois-Rivières, Sherbrooke, and Saguenay.

PEI has some of the lowest international tuition rates in Canada. For individuals looking for a sense of community and a small-town environment, PEI could be the perfect choice. Rolling hills, woods, sand beaches, ocean coves and the famous red soil have justifiably given Prince Edward Island a reputation as a province of outstanding natural beauty.
The University of Prince Edward Island adheres to the Pan-Canadian Protocol on the Transferability of University Credits, which states that all course work completed by transfer students during the first two years of university study in Canada (including the final year of studies in Quebec leading to a diploma of college studies and the university transfer courses offered by community colleges and university colleges in British Columbia and Alberta) will be recognized and fully credited for the purposes of granting a degree.

Where exceptional circumstances exist, however, someone may be allowed to apply even if he or she has not been physically resident in Canada for the required 1,095 days. The requirement to be physically present in Canada for 1,095 days does not apply to children under the age of 18.

        Unlike Canadian permanent residents, Canadian citizens have no residency obligations. Canadian citizens cannot lose their status unless it was obtained through material misrepresentation. 
Canadian citizens also receive Canadian passports and are entitled to vote in federal, provincial, and municipal elections.

        4. Will time spent in Canada before becoming a permanent resident count towards a citizenship application?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Currently, IRCC regulations dictate that applicants must be physically present in Canada as a permanent resident for 1,095 days within the five (5) years immediately before applying for citizenship. 
Only the five years preceding the date of the application are taken into account. Within that five-year period:

Every day spent in Canada as a permanent resident counts as a full day.
Every day spent in Canada before becoming a permanent resident as a temporary resident or protected person counts as a half-day towards meeting the physical presence requirement for citizenship, up to a maximum credit of 365 days.
If the applicant became a permanent resident less than five years ago, the calculation period starts on the date that he or she became a permanent resident.
Time spent serving a sentence in Canada does not count towards the physical presence requirement (i.e. time spent in a prison, penitentiary, jail, reformatory, probation and/or on parole cannot be counted as physical presence).

        7. Does Canada recognize dual citizenship?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Since 1977, Canada has permitted its citizens to hold dual or multi citizenship. As a result, Canadian citizens will not lose their Canadian citizenship if they retain their former nationality or become citizens of another country. Many other countries, including the United States, also recognize dual citizenship.
It is advised that a permanent resident intending to become a Canadian citizen verifies whether the country of his or her current nationality permits dual citizenship.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        A child must be a permanent resident of Canada to become a citizen. The physical presence requirement of 1,095 days does not apply to children under the age of 18. In order to apply for citizenship for a child under the age of 18, one of the child's parents must already be a Canadian citizen, or must apply for citizenship at the same time. This applies to adoptive children as well.

        7. How do I qualify for deemed rehabilitation?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        You may be deemed rehabilitated if:

You have been convicted for two or more summary convictions and five years have passed since the sentence was completed; or
You have been convicted of a non-serious indictable offence (e.g. DUI) and more than 10 years have passed since the sentence was completed; and
If the crime you committed would be punishable in Canada by a maximum prison term of less than 10 years.

        An indictable offence commonly refers to more serious offences in the Canadian Criminal Code and can result in greater penalties than summary convictions. For example, Operation While Impaired is considered an indictable offence. While nearly all felonies in the United States are equivalent to indictable offences in Canada, many misdemeanor offences are also considered indictable offences in Canada, and a thorough review of the foreign law must be done to determine the equivalent offence under Canadian law.

        A summary conviction commonly refers to minor offences in the Canadian Criminal Code. For example, Disturbing the Peace, is considered a summary offence. While most summary offences in Canada are equivalent to misdemeanors in the United States, this is not always the case, and a thorough review of the foreign law must be done to determine the equivalent offence under Canadian law.

        1. What is a Police Certificate?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        All applicants for Canada Immigration (Permanent Resident) Visas, 18 years of age and older, may need to submit a Police Certificate from each country in which they have resided as part of the security clearance process. Police Certificates may go by different names in different countries. They are official documents that indicate any prior criminal activity. If officials in a particular country refuse to issue a Police Certificate, it would be helpful if you could obtain a written statement from them confirming that they refused to issue the certificate.

        2. When must I submit the Police Certificate?

        This depends on the category of Canada immigration under which you are applying and the Canadian Immigration Visa Office to which your application is being submitted. Police Certificates are only valid for a limited period of time. For more detailed information, you should seek expert advice or get instructions from the Canadian Immigration Visa Office where you will submit your application.

        If a Police Certificate is not forthcoming from a particular country, a written statement from the police officials of the country confirming their refusal to issue the certificate may be required. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) may even waive this requirement altogether if a clear obstacle can be demonstrated. Applicants should assume that certificates must be obtained.

        A hybrid offence is an offence that may be prosecuted in Canada either by way of indictment or summary conviction. A conviction for an act outside Canada that is equivalent to a hybrid offence in Canada will be considered an indictable offence for Canada immigration purposes. Even if the conviction was a summary conviction in the location where it occurred, it will still be considered an indictable offence by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) as long as the offence is equivalent to a hybrid offence in Canada.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Persons who are inadmissible on grounds of criminality may still be permitted to enter Canada if they qualify for deemed rehabilitation.
Persons qualify for deemed rehabilitation if they have:

Been convicted outside Canada of an act that, if committed in Canada, would be equivalent to an indictable offence punishable by a sentence of less than ten years, and they meet the following requirements:

Ten years have elapsed since the completion of their sentence;
They have not been convicted of any indictable offence or summary offence in Canada in the last ten years, or more than one summary conviction in the ten years before that; and
They have not been convicted outside Canada of an offence in the last ten years that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence, or of more than one summary conviction in the ten years before that.



OR

Been convicted outside Canada of two or more acts that, if committed in Canada, would be equivalent to summary offences, and they meet the following requirements:

Five years have elapsed since the completion of their sentences;
They have not been convicted of any indictable offence or summary offence in Canada in the last five years, or more than one summary conviction in the five years before that; and
They have not been convicted outside Canada of an offence in the last five years that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence, or of more than one summary conviction in the five years before that.



OR

Committed an act outside Canada that, if committed in Canada, would be equivalent to an indictable offence punishable by a sentence of less than ten years, and they meet the following requirements:

Ten years have elapsed since the completion of their sentence;
They have not been convicted of any indictable offence or summary offence in Canada in the last ten years, or more than one summary conviction in the ten years before that; and
They have not been convicted outside Canada of an offence in the last ten years that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence, or of more than one summary conviction in the ten years before that.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         Persons who are inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality cannot qualify for deemed rehabilitation; that is, simple passage of time after the completion of their sentence does not alone qualify them for rehabilitated status.
However, persons who fall under the serious criminality classification, as well as others who do not qualify for deemed rehabilitation, may still qualify under the individual rehabilitation category.
To qualify for individual rehabilitation, the person must:

Wait five years after the completion of their sentence before applying; and
Demonstrate that they have been rehabilitated and are no longer a risk for criminal activity. This may require demonstrating:

A stable lifestyle
Community ties
Social and vocational skills
That the criminal offence was an isolated event

        13. If I cannot qualify for rehabilitation, are there any other options available if I need to enter Canada with a criminally inadmissible record?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Yes. If the applicable rehabilitation requirements have not been met, but an otherwise criminally inadmissible person has a pressing need to enter Canada, a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) may be granted. A TRP will only be granted if the danger to the Canadian public is outweighed by the criminally inadmissible person's need to be in Canada. Therefore, both the seriousness of the person's prior offence(s) and the legitimate urgency of their need to enter Canada (such as visiting a dying relative) will factor into the decision.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
         No. You do not need a Temporary Resident Visa to visit Canada if you are from a visa-exempt country. In this case, a visa-exempt person flying to Canada would need to apply for and obtain an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) (eTA) before boarding his or her flight. If traveling to Canada over land, a visa-exempt person does not need either a TRV or an eTA.
Citizens from all other countries must apply for a Temporary Resident Visa before entering Canada, unless otherwise exempt.

        In general, international students require a study permit to pursue an educational program in Canada. However, there are several exceptions to this rule. If your program in Canada is less than six months in duration you do not require a study permit, although it may be a good idea to apply for one in case you decide to continue your studies. As well, you may study in Canada without a study permit if you are a family member or staff member of a foreign representative accredited by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada. You should contact your embassy in Canada for more information. In addition, if you are a member of a foreign armed force under the Visiting Forces Act, you will not be required to obtain a study permit. If your family members wish to study in Canada, they must meet the requirements. Finally, if you are in Canada on a work permit or student visa, your minor children can study at the secondary or elementary level. They must first enter Canada on a visitor visa.

		Frequently asked questions about electronic Travel Authorization.
Canada has introduced a new entry requirement, known as an electronic Travel Authorization, also known as eTA, for visa-exempt foreign nationals travelling to Canada by air. Entry requirements for other methods of travel (land, sea) have not changed.




    
        +
        -
        1. Why did Canada introduce electronic Travel Authorization?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The system allows the government of Canada to tailor screening requirements based on the risks posed by individual travellers, making it easier and faster for low-risk travellers to come to Canada. Previously, visa-exempt foreign nationals seeking entry to Canada are not systematically screened for admissibility until they arrive at a Canadian port of entry.
The number of visa-exempt foreign nationals travelling to Canada on a temporary basis per year is significantly larger than the number of visa-required travellers. For example, visa-exempt foreign nationals, excluding U.S. citizens, represent approximately 74 per cent of foreign nationals who arrive by air in Canada.

Visa-exempt foreign nationals are expected to have an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to fly to or transit through Canada. Exceptions include U.S. citizens, and travellers with a valid Canadian visa. Canadian citizens, including dual citizens, and Canadian permanent residents are not eligible to apply for an eTA.

        No. An eTA is only required for visa-exempt travellers. Citizens of countries that are not currently visa-exempt country who wish to enter Canada for a temporary purpose, such as tourists, temporary foreign workers (work permits) and international students (study permits), must apply for and be granted a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV). The TRV is a document issued by a Canadian Immigration Visa Office outside Canada, showing that the holder has satisfied the requirements for admission to Canada as a visitor. Temporary Resident Visas may be for single entry or multiple entry.

When flying to Canada, you will need to present:

proof of status in the U.S. (such as a valid Green Card), and
your valid passport that you used to apply for your eTA.

The Canadian border services officer will verify your eTA when you arrive in Canada.

        If you are waiting for someone (e.g. police department, doctor) or another third party to send you documents, or have problems uploading the documents and cannot submit them by the deadline, you may submit a case specific enquiry to request an extension to the deadline.
If you are not sure how to submit the documents requested for your eTA application, follow these step-by-step instructions.

        20. Do individuals who obtain a study permit or work permit also need to apply for an eTA?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        As of August 1, 2015, individuals who are issued an initial study or work permit will automatically be issued an eTA along with their permit. For work permit or study permit renewal applications, the eTA will not be automatically renewed. If you wish to exit and re-enter Canada by air, you will need to ensure that your eTA is still valid.

        21. Do all work permits/study permits issued by visa posts, ports-of-entry, and Vegreville after Aug 1, 2015 have ETAs attached to them?  If so, how do I find out what the ETA number is?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Study permits and work permits issued to visa-exempt foreign nationals on or after August 1, 2015 had an eTA issued with them. The only work permits and study permits issued on or after August 1 that would not have had an eTA issued with them are work permit and study permit extensions issued by the Vegreville Case Processing Centre in Alberta. For ease of reference, the eTA number can be found in the Letter of Introduction given to study permit and work permit holders.

        22. If an ETA is issued with a work permit/study permit, is it valid for the length of time of the work permit/study permit or is it valid for 5 years (or when the passport expires, if it’s before 5 years)?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The validity of an eTA issued to a visa-exempt foreign national alongside a work or study permit is independent from that of the permit; therefore, the eTA is valid for five years or passport expiry, whichever occurs sooner. That same eTA can be used for multiple entries to Canada, including after March 15, 2016. In addition, the eTA is electronically linked to the individual's passport; therefore, s/he must use that same passport when travelling to Canada.

        23. If an individual received a work permit or study permit at a Canadian Port of Entry but did not received a confirmation letter afterwards,  how would he or she check whether he or she has been issued an eTA and what the eTA number is?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        In this instance, in order to obtain the eTA number, the individuals should submit a case-specific enquiry form to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) explaining the situation. An email response from IRCC will contain the eTA number.

        24. If an individual does not know his or her eTA number (for example, if he or she wasn’t told what his or her eTA number when receiving a work permit at a Port of Entry), would he or she then able to apply again for another eTA? Would the system prevent someone from getting two eTAs?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Individuals who find themselves in this situation, or who simply wish to re-apply for a new eTA, may do so at any time. Once the more recent eTA is approved, it will replace the one that already exists. If the individual applies for another eTA, but on a different passport, that eTA – once approved – would not replace the one that already exists; it would be tied to the second passport, which the individual could use when travelling to Canada by air. In either case, the system will not prevent the individual from proceeding.

        25. What are the possible reasons for refusal?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Reasons for refusal may be for prior criminality or for medical reasons.
In terms of criminal inadmissibility, something as seemingly minor as an old DUI (Driving Under the Influence) going back a number of years can result in being rejected. Even if the crime was minor in nature, and even if the person’s criminal record has been clean since it took place, Canada still has the right to deny entry.
Some examples of convictions that could make you inadmissible to Canada include: DWAI, Theft, Petty Theft/Larceny, Assault, Drunk & Disorderly Conduct, Obstruction of Justice, Possession of marijuana, cocaine or other controlled substances/drugs, and cautions (issued in the United Kingdom).
More serious reasons for refusal can include membership in terrorist organizations, espionage, participation in war crimes or crimes against humanity, international human rights violations, membership in organized crime groups, criminality, or issues endangering public health, such as tuberculosis.
In 2012–2013, the total number of visa-exempt foreign nationals who arrived in Canada and were deemed inadmissible for entry at air ports of entry was 7,055. This resulted in significant expense, delay and inconvenience for these foreign nationals, other travellers, the airlines and the Canadian government. As such, the eTA system has been brought into operation.

        26. If I am refused an eTA, is there some way I can still visit Canada?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Citizens of eTA-required (i.e. TRV-exempt) countries who are refused an eTA may be issued a temporary resident permit depending on the nature and circumstances of the inadmissibility and the continuing rationale for travel. The visa office responsible for the applicant's country may have its own application form for temporary resident permits. Applicants should check the visa office to find out about its specific application procedures.

        27. Is the eTA system similar to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) in use by the United States of America?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        The eTA system mirrors the current U.S. Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) program, and is very similar to it in a number of ways. The governments of Canada and the U.S. have stated that eTA and ESTA systems form a common approach to screening travellers outside the North American perimeter.

        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        Visa-exempt foreign nationals who have been issued a Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR) document also receives an electronic authorization to travel to Canada and, therefore, does not need an eTA. This process is not visible to these individuals, and they do not need to print out any additional information. They will, however, need to travel to Canada with their valid passport and valid Confirmation of Permanent Residence document.

        31. When will citizens from Brazil, Bulgaria, and Romania be able to apply for an eTA?
        Click to collapse
        
    


    
        There is no confirmed date yet for eTA expansion for Brazil, however, it is expected to be implemented only after eTA is fully implemented for citizens who do not need a visa to come to Canada. Until then, citizens from Brazil still need a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) to travel to Canada. As of December 1, 2017, the government has lifted the visa requirements for citizens of Romania and Bulgaria. Citizens of those two countries no longer require a TRV, but eTA requirements apply.
